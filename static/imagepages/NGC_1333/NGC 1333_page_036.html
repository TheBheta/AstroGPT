<H1> The NGC 1333 star forming region</H1>
<P>
The NGC 1333 dark cloud, located at a distance of about 300 pc
in the Perseus molecular cloud complex, is one of the most active
star forming region near the sun.
</p>

<P>
The first image is a RGB composit of deep J, H, and K band images I
have obtained at the 3.5 m telescope on Calar Alto. Note the
numerous jets and outflows from the young stars.

The next two images are deep X-ray images obtained from archival
Chandra observations (left) and XMM observations (right) of the region.
Note the larger field-of-view of the XMM image.
