<H2>Ionized Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in NGC 1333</H2>

<H3>Sloan, Bregman, Allamandola (NASA Ames), Hayward, DeVito (Cornell),
Geballe (JAC), & Woodward (Wyoming)</H3>

Now published as an ApJ Letter (March, 1999).  See the 
<A HREF="../library/1999/ngc99.html">abstract</A> for more information.<P>

<H3>To get right to the point, we have made the first direct, unambiguous
identification of ionized PAHs in the interstellar medium.</H3>

<A HREF="pah_info.html">Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</A> represent 
as much as 15-20% of all interstellar carbon, and they are the largest 
organic molecules detected in space so far.  They could represent the 
initial stages in the formation of exotic molecules like amino acids or 
buckyballs.  Now, on with the story.<P>

(the plates are actually black and white).  The white box marks the area 
of the infrared image below (Fig. 2).<P>

NGC 1333 is complex of nebulae created by star formation.  We focus on
the reflection nebula around SVS3, an early or mid B star.  This nebula
is a source of strong PAH emission (shown in the next image).<P>

Fig. 2 (above).  An image taken at 3.3 &#181;m at the NASA 1.5 m telescope 
at Mt. Lemmon Observatory.  Most of the emission at this wavelength is from 
PAH molecules.  The long narrow rectangles mark the positions of our 
near-infrared and mid-infrared spectroscopy (below) in Fig. 3 and 5.<P>

Fig. 3 (above).  A long-slit spectral image of NGC 1333, obtained at the 
3.8 m United Kingdom Infrared Telescope with CGS4 at wavelengths of 
3.1-3.7 &#181;m.  In a spectral image, the wavelength of the light changes
along the horizontal axis while the spatial position in the slit changes
along the vertical axis.  Spectra extracted from this image are shown 
below (Fig. 4).<P>

Fig. 4 (above).  Spectra extracted from the long-slit 3 &#181;m spectra 
in three regions south of SVS 3.  As the distance from SVS 3 increases,
the spectrum changes, with the contribution from the 3.40 &#181;m PAH 
feature increasing with respect to the 3.29 &#181;m PAH feature.  The
3.29 &#181;m PAH feature generally dominates this spectral region 
because it arises from a C-H stretch in the aromatic rings in the PAHs.
The 3.40 &#181;m PAH feature, on the other hand, arises from an aliphatic
C-H stretch.  This means that it does not come from the aromatic
rings which dominate the spectrum, but from a C-H bond in some other
structure.  Since the feature is getting stronger with respect to
the aromatic C-H stretch further away from SVS3, we can infer that
the aliphatic C-H bonds are more fragile and cannot survive close
to SVS3 where the radiation field is harsher.<P>

Fig. 5 (above).  A long-slit spectral image of NGC 1333 in the 
mid-infrared, taken on the 5 m Hale reflector at Palomar with 
SpectroCam-10.  The slit position is shown in Fig. 2, and spectra 
extracted from this image are shown below in Fig. 6.<P>

Fig. 6 (above).  Four spectra extracted from our mid-infrared spectral 
data of NGC 1333 by dividing the 16" slit into four 4" strips.  The 
bottom panels show the 8.6, 11.2, and 12.7 &#181;m features with the 
continuum subtracted for easy comparison.  In all panels, the blue 
spectrum is on SVS 3, and the colors go through green, yellow, and red 
with increasing distance to the south.<P>

The 8.6 &#181;m feature behaves very differently from the 3.3, 3.4, 11.2, 
or 12.7 &#181;m PAH features.  While these latter features generally increase
in strength to a maximum about south of SVS 3, the 8.6 um feature shows
a broad region of emission peaking 5-8 arcsec south of SVS 3.  Usually,
the 8.6 &#181;m PAH feature is attributed to in-plane C-H bends, while the
11.2, 11.9, and 12.7 &#181;m features arise from out-of-plane C-H bends
and the 3 &#181;m feature arise from C-H stretches.
The different behavior of the 8.6 &#181;m feature either could arise from
an in-plane C-H bend in a very different PAH species that we
aren't seeing in other parts of the nebula, or from some other excitation
mode enhanced closer in to SVS 3 (i.e., it may not be an in-plane
C-H bend at all!).<P>

We have discovered an emission feature at 10 &#181;m centered on SVS 3 (blue
curve in the top panel above) that does not appear elsewhere.  We have 
also discovered very complicated spatial and spectral structure to the 
11.2 &#181;m PAH feature.  Both of these points are illustrated and discussed
below.<P>

Fig. 7 (above).  A more careful look at the 10 &#181;m emission feature seen 
directly on SVS 3 (left) and the fine-scale structure in the 11.2 &#181;m 
feature.  Each curve is for a one-arcsecond strip, starting on SVS 3
(purple) and continuing through the rainbow to a position 8 arcseconds 
to the south (red).  We have removed the continuum from each spectrum.
To emphasize the variations in the 11.2 &#181;m feature (right), 
we have normalized each row.  We have not normalized the spectra of the 
10 um feature (left).<P>

There appear to be two extra features to the blue of the 11.2 &#181;m
feature, one at 10.8 and one at 11.0 &#181;m.  The 10.8 &#181;m feature 
disappears quickly away from SVS3, but the 11.0 &#181;m feature lingers 
out to a distance of 7-8" south.  We suggest that the 10 &#181;m and 
10.8 &#181;m feature arise from the same carrier, which can only exist
in the immediate vicinity of SVS 3 , while the 11.0 &#181;m feature 
exists from a carrier which can exist further away, although not out to 
10 arcseconds where the stronger 11.2 &#181;m PAH feature peaks.<P>

In ionized PAHs, the 11.2 &#181;m feature will shift to shorter 
wavelengths by ~0.3 &#181;m, right to the vicinity of 10.8 and 11.0 
&#181;m where we see the new features.  The spatial distribution of 
these features is also fully consistent with what would be expected 
for ionized PAHs - they appear only very near the exciting source.<P>

We're pretty excited about all this.  PAHs certainly produce the 
well-known emission features at 3.3, 3.4, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.2, and 12.7
&#181;m, but generally, the fit between laboratory and astronomical data
has been disappointing.  Work by Hudgins and Allamandola shows that
ionized PAHs provide a much better spectral fit, but there has been
some doubt in the astronomical community about whether PAHs would 
actually be ionized in astrophysical environments, and if so whether
they would survive long enough to be detected.  Our results should
eliminate these doubts.<P>
