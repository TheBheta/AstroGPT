        <p>We recently published a paper to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
        Society (Irwin et al., 2020. MNRAS, 493, 106 - 125. doi: 
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa238">https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa238</a>) 
        presenting a reanalysis of phase curve observations of WASP-43b using a novel 
        2.5-D retrieval model. The ArXiv version of this paper is <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03233"> here </A>.</p>

        <p>In this paper we attempt to fit the temperature profile and abundance at all longititudes, altitides and latitudes
        simultaneously, making the assumption that properties vary with latitude as (cos(latitude))^n, where n is an
        assumed coefficient. We call this approach a 2.5-D retrieval.</p>

        Using a model based on a GCM we simulate what a planet such as WASP-43b will look like, here in the Spitzer/IRAC 
        channel centred at 4.5 microns. It can be seen that the temperatures vary greatly across the planet. We then perform a full 
        disc ingration across our synthetic planet at all 15 HST/WFC3 and 2 Spitzer/IRAC channels at
        the fifteen different phases reported by 
        <A HREF="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/153/2/68"> Stevenson et al. (2017) </A> to produce phase
        curves that approximately match observations. We then add on noise and and fit the synthetic phase
        curves with our 
        <A HREF="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2007.11.006"> NEMESIS </A> radiative transfer and 
        retrieval model. Having fitted the synthetic observations, we then recomputed how the planet would actually look at
        4.5 microns.

        Here are the results using a simple 1-D model. Here we assume that at each phase the temperatures and abundances are the same at all points on the disc. 
        While this is easy to model, it does not recognise that in fact temperatures vary across the disc. Hence
        in this sort of retrieval the dayside temperatures are cooler than they should really be and the nightside temperatures
        are warmer.

        <br>
        <img src=animations/gcm-2pt5D-fit_0pt25.gif width=200 align=right>
        However, when we use our 2.5-D model, with n=0.25, we simulate this appearance.
        It can be seen here that the hot parts of the planet are more tightly constrained to the dayside. In addition the
        the magnitude of the temperature variations is closer to the simulation. The north-south variation in our model is
        contained in the n-coefficient.

        <br>
        <img src=animations/gcm-2pt5D-fit_1pt0.gif width=200 align=right>
        If instead we set n=1.0 we get the following simultion. 
        This simulation looks less realistic and actually doesn't fit the synthetic observations as well.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        It can be seen that the 2.5-D model approach more realistically simulates the appearance of our model planet and recovers more
        consistent temperatures. We then applied our model to the observed phase curves of <A HREF="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/153/2/68"> 
        Stevenson et al. (2017). </A></p>

        <p>Here are the results of the simulated appearance of WASP-43b using our 1-D, 2.5-D (n=0.25) and 2.5-D (n=1.0)  models:</p>

        <br>

        <img src=animations/stev-2pt5D-fit_1pt0.gif width=250>
        <br>

        To see these with the correct relative phase to eachother, here is a comparison, between the GCM, 
        the 1-D model and the 2.5-D (n=0.25) model:

        <br> 

        <img src=animations/animated.gif width=750>
        <br>

        <p>It is clear that the nightside of the real WASP-43b is much colder than the GCM-based simulation. Such a stark 
        temperature difference is difficult to explain with dynamical models, but one explanation is that the nightside
        may be covered with a cloud that lowers the radiation to space. To model this we repeated our retrievals, but 
        set the nightside temperatures to be very cold (500K).</>

        <p>Here are the results using a 2.5-D model, with n=0.25, nightside set to 500K:</p>

        <p>Here are the results using a 2.5-D model, with n=1.0, nightside set to 500K:</p>
        <img src=animations/stev-2pt5D-fit_1pt0_dark.gif width=250>
        <br>
        <p>Our 2.5-D model, with n=0.25 and a dark nightside provides the best fit to the observations.
