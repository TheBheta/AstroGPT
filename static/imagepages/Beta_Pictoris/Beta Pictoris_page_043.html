        <meta property="og:description" content="Imaging the Circumstellar Disc around Beta Pictoris with Amateur Equipment     This image shows the famous circumstellar disc of debris and dust orbiting the star Beta Pictoris 63.4 light years away. This is a very young system thought to be only around 12 million years old and is essentially similar to how our own Solar System must have formed some 4.5 billion years ago. The disc is seen edge-on from our perspective and appears in professional images as thin wedges or lines protruding radially from the central star in opposite directions. For the last couple of years I have been wondering if it was possible for amateurs to capture this special target but have never come across any such images. The main difficulty is the overwhelming glare from Beta Pictoris itself which completely drowns out the dust disc that is circling very close to the star. Images of the disc taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and from big observatories, are usually made by physically blocking out the glare of Beta Pictoris itself within the optical path. But I then found this excellent 1993 paper &#039;Observation of the central part of the beta Pictoris disk with an anti-blooming CCD&#039; (Lecavelier des Etangs, A., Perrin, G., Ferlet, R., Vidal-Madjar, A., Colas, F., et al., 1993, A&amp;A, 274, 877) Full article available here: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993A%26A...274..877L   I realised that with this technique it might not be entirely impossible to also record the debris disc with relatively modest equipment. I followed the technique described in the paper above, which basically consists of imaging Beta and then taking another image of a similar reference star under the same conditions. The two images are subtracted from each other to eliminate the stellar glare, and the dust disc should then hopefully reveal itself. However, since the two stars have different magnitudes I needed to calculate how long to expose Alpha for in order to get a similar image which I could subtract from the Beta image:   The magnitude difference between the stars is 3.86(Beta) - 3.30(Alpha) = 0.56 Due to the logarithmic nature of the magnitude scale we know that a difference of 1 magnitude equals a brightness ratio of 2.512. Therefore 2.512 to the power of the numerical magnitude difference then equals the variation in brightness. 2.5120.56 = 1.67, so it appears Alpha is 1.67 times brighter than Beta. This means that exposure for Alpha should be 1/1.67 = 0.597 times that of Beta.    With this approach I managed to capture the first amateur image of the debris disc on 16th November 2011. This image generated a lot of attention from both professional and amateur astronomers and was reported in the media all over the world.   After the initial success of capturing the disc I was contacted by several people in the astronomy community, among which were Dr Grant Christie of Auckland&#039;s Stardome Observatory. Following his suggestions I had a go at imaging it again using shorter exposures. This was to minimise the area saturated by Beta Pictoris itself and potentially reveal more of the debris disc closer to the star. The ICX098BQ chip in the ToUCam saturates fairly quickly for bright stars, even at very short exposures. Since long exposures with my ToUCam can only be controlled in 0.5s increments I decided to use 7.0s and 4.0s for Beta and Alpha respectively, which translates to a factor of 0.571. This was very close to the calculated brightness factor of 0.597 and still significantly shorter than the 30.0s I used for the first image on 16/11/2011.   So for this second image I collected 344 images of Beta Pictoris at 7.0 seconds each and 299 images of Alpha Pictoris at 4.0s each. Both sets of images were dark subtracted and stacked separately in Registax. I then subtracted the Alpha image from the Beta image in PixInsight LE, and also created the absolute difference between the two. The absolute difference image is simply easier to work with, but the subtraction image was important as a reference to examine which of the stars had contributed the various parts of the difference. Below are both the subtraction result (left) and the absolute difference (right):           In the subtraction image on the left contributions from Alpha Pictoris are dark, while contributions from Beta Pictoris are light. It is clear that there is a fairly strong signal corresponding to the exact location of the debris disc and that it is coming from the Beta image.   I created a more natural looking final image by taking the original stacked Beta image and then blending in the central parts from a stretched version of the absolute difference image that showed the dust disc. I decided to also keep the black spot of the central glare from the difference image since the contrast with the protruding disc just seems better this way. So there is no occulting disc involved, it is simply for the sake of presentation. I created a couple of versions which can be seen in the gallery below. This is a vastly better image than the first one taken on 16/11/2011. I believe the higher number of subframes (344 versus 55) coupled with the shorter exposure times are responsible for the improvement.   I used MaximDL to produce some more in-depth illustrations of what is going on in the difference image. First a area plot of the intensity immediately around Beta Pictoris. The circular plateau in the centre corresponds to the saturated area caused by Beta Pictoris itself (The narrow trough immediately surrounding it is an artifact of the image processing). The debris disc is visible as the elevated red areas on each side of the star:      And profile plots taken both through the debris disc plane and perpendicular to it. The horizontal scale is Astronomical Units and the area saturated by Beta itself is highlighted on the plots:      The visible part of the debris disc seems to extend to roughly 250-300AU before it falls below the background noise levels.  I have found that the limiting magnitude with the ToUCam from my location is around 20.0. So how far out should the debris disc theoretically be visible in my image? This is a plot of the magnitude pr. square arcsecond for the debris disc (Smith, B. A. &amp; Terrile, R. J. 1984, Science, 226, 1421 A Circumstellar Disk around Beta Pictoris):       It seems from the figure above that if a limiting magnitude of approximately 20.0 is assumed, then the debris disc should be visible out to somewhere around 250-300AU. This corresponds with what is seen in the profile plots above.    This annotated crop of the final image shows the extent of the debris disc on both sides of Beta itself:      Some notes on ToUCam and IR sensitivity The disc is most prominent in IR and fortunately the ICX098BQ CCD chip is very good at picking up signals in IR, probably on par with or even better than some modern CCD&#039;s in this aspect. Another property of the ICX098BQ that helps here is actually the Bayer colour matrix. This is because each pixel either receives only red, green or blue light due to the overlaid Bayer matrix. But since the matrix dyes are practically transparent to IR light, every pixel therefore receives signal from the IR band. So the IR S/N ratio in the final image can be assumed to be correspondingly higher than the RGB S/N. This could easily explain why the ToUCam seems to pick up IR light so well; the Bayer matrix effectively acts like a IR pass filter and allows a proportionally higher number of pixels to be IR illuminated than RGB illuminated. While I have not tested this in practice it could mean that the limiting magnitude of the ToUCam is higher in IR than in RGB.

The subtraction technique is a great idea. I wonder if you could get even better results with an ICX618 chip, which has greater sensitivity as well as being harder to saturate ! It may reveal even more of the disk...  I love your presentation, too. The 3-d plot with the axes in au&#039;s is really cool.

Peige Wise  Guest agpvanlieshout@home.nl	29-Nov-2011 15:47 Yeahhhhhhh great, feeling must be amazing  Guest	29-Nov-2011 13:51 Dear Mr Olsen,  First: CONGRATULATION for this great image of the Beta Pictoris dust disk !!  This image remembers me when (with Guy Perrin, Alfred Vidal-Madjar, Fran&ccedil;ois Colas and others) we obtained very similar images in 1992. It was a great time. I have no doubt that this is really the disk of Beta Pic that you have in your image: its looks so similar to what we obtained. Captured with a 10&quot; telescope, your image represents a very nice achievement and a technical exploit. CONGRATULATION!!  As I wrote to a journalist asking me, I feel that it is unlikely that your image can be used to learn something new about this Beta Pictoris system. But this is not the most important: the most important is that your image is impressive and beautiful. A beautiful image of a young planetary system 62 light-years away, a beautiful image among other beautiful images in your pbase galleries.  Nonetheless, your work shows that amateur can obtain results which are potentially useful for scientists. In particular, I think about transit of exoplanets some of which can be surveyed by amateur astronomers. By the way, this gives me the opportunity to send a call for photometric survey of Beta Pictoris, which can be done by (expert) amateurs. Indeed, in 1994 we discovered that a planet likely transited in front of Beta Pictoris in 1981. In 1994, the claim for the observation of a transiting exoplanet was regarded as very suspicious. But the things have changed, and since 2008 we know that a planet orbits around Beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al. 2008), moreover the imaged planet is very consistent with a transit in 1981 (Lecavelier &amp; Vidal-Madjar 2009). To predict when the next transit will happen a survey of Beta Pictoris photometry is needed. In that regard, the help from amateur can be useful.  A comment: in contrary to the title of the photo, the Beta Pictoris disk is not &quot;protoplanetary&quot;, this is a &quot;debris disk&quot;. The dust seen in the image is not massive enough for a new planet to form. This dust is produced by collision between asteroids and/or evaporation of comets: the dusty grains captured in your photo are the debris of minor bodies orbiting in a young and active planetary system, similar to our own solar system when it was a few million years old.  Congratulation again !  Alain Lecavelier des Etangs  Guest j.berg100@chello.nl	29-Nov-2011 13:05 congratulations, Spectacular!  Guest	29-Nov-2011 10:11 I take my hat off to you sir!

        <meta name="twitter:title" content="The Circumstellar Disc of Beta Pictoris - Rolf Olsen"/>
        <meta name="twitter:description" content="Imaging the Circumstellar Disc around Beta Pictoris with Amateur Equipment     This image shows the famous circumstellar disc of debris and dust orbiting the star Beta Pictoris 63.4 light years away. This is a very young system thought to be only around 12 million years old and is essentially similar to how our own Solar System must have formed some 4.5 billion years ago. The disc is seen edge-on from our perspective and appears in professional images as thin wedges or lines protruding radially from the central star in opposite directions. For the last couple of years I have been wondering if it was possible for amateurs to capture this special target but have never come across any such images. The main difficulty is the overwhelming glare from Beta Pictoris itself which completely drowns out the dust disc that is circling very close to the star. Images of the disc taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and from big observatories, are usually made by physically blocking out the glare of Beta Pictoris itself within the optical path. But I then found this excellent 1993 paper &#039;Observation of the central part of the beta Pictoris disk with an anti-blooming CCD&#039; (Lecavelier des Etangs, A., Perrin, G., Ferlet, R., Vidal-Madjar, A., Colas, F., et al., 1993, A&amp;A, 274, 877) Full article available here: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993A%26A...274..877L   I realised that with this technique it might not be entirely impossible to also record the debris disc with relatively modest equipment. I followed the technique described in the paper above, which basically consists of imaging Beta and then taking another image of a similar reference star under the same conditions. The two images are subtracted from each other to eliminate the stellar glare, and the dust disc should then hopefully reveal itself. However, since the two stars have different magnitudes I needed to calculate how long to expose Alpha for in order to get a similar image which I could subtract from the Beta image:   The magnitude difference between the stars is 3.86(Beta) - 3.30(Alpha) = 0.56 Due to the logarithmic nature of the magnitude scale we know that a difference of 1 magnitude equals a brightness ratio of 2.512. Therefore 2.512 to the power of the numerical magnitude difference then equals the variation in brightness. 2.5120.56 = 1.67, so it appears Alpha is 1.67 times brighter than Beta. This means that exposure for Alpha should be 1/1.67 = 0.597 times that of Beta.    With this approach I managed to capture the first amateur image of the debris disc on 16th November 2011. This image generated a lot of attention from both professional and amateur astronomers and was reported in the media all over the world.   After the initial success of capturing the disc I was contacted by several people in the astronomy community, among which were Dr Grant Christie of Auckland&#039;s Stardome Observatory. Following his suggestions I had a go at imaging it again using shorter exposures. This was to minimise the area saturated by Beta Pictoris itself and potentially reveal more of the debris disc closer to the star. The ICX098BQ chip in the ToUCam saturates fairly quickly for bright stars, even at very short exposures. Since long exposures with my ToUCam can only be controlled in 0.5s increments I decided to use 7.0s and 4.0s for Beta and Alpha respectively, which translates to a factor of 0.571. This was very close to the calculated brightness factor of 0.597 and still significantly shorter than the 30.0s I used for the first image on 16/11/2011.   So for this second image I collected 344 images of Beta Pictoris at 7.0 seconds each and 299 images of Alpha Pictoris at 4.0s each. Both sets of images were dark subtracted and stacked separately in Registax. I then subtracted the Alpha image from the Beta image in PixInsight LE, and also created the absolute difference between the two. The absolute difference image is simply easier to work with, but the subtraction image was important as a reference to examine which of the stars had contributed the various parts of the difference. Below are both the subtraction result (left) and the absolute difference (right):           In the subtraction image on the left contributions from Alpha Pictoris are dark, while contributions from Beta Pictoris are light. It is clear that there is a fairly strong signal corresponding to the exact location of the debris disc and that it is coming from the Beta image.   I created a more natural looking final image by taking the original stacked Beta image and then blending in the central parts from a stretched version of the absolute difference image that showed the dust disc. I decided to also keep the black spot of the central glare from the difference image since the contrast with the protruding disc just seems better this way. So there is no occulting disc involved, it is simply for the sake of presentation. I created a couple of versions which can be seen in the gallery below. This is a vastly better image than the first one taken on 16/11/2011. I believe the higher number of subframes (344 versus 55) coupled with the shorter exposure times are responsible for the improvement.   I used MaximDL to produce some more in-depth illustrations of what is going on in the difference image. First a area plot of the intensity immediately around Beta Pictoris. The circular plateau in the centre corresponds to the saturated area caused by Beta Pictoris itself (The narrow trough immediately surrounding it is an artifact of the image processing). The debris disc is visible as the elevated red areas on each side of the star:      And profile plots taken both through the debris disc plane and perpendicular to it. The horizontal scale is Astronomical Units and the area saturated by Beta itself is highlighted on the plots:      The visible part of the debris disc seems to extend to roughly 250-300AU before it falls below the background noise levels.  I have found that the limiting magnitude with the ToUCam from my location is around 20.0. So how far out should the debris disc theoretically be visible in my image? This is a plot of the magnitude pr. square arcsecond for the debris disc (Smith, B. A. &amp; Terrile, R. J. 1984, Science, 226, 1421 A Circumstellar Disk around Beta Pictoris):       It seems from the figure above that if a limiting magnitude of approximately 20.0 is assumed, then the debris disc should be visible out to somewhere around 250-300AU. This corresponds with what is seen in the profile plots above.    This annotated crop of the final image shows the extent of the debris disc on both sides of Beta itself:      Some notes on ToUCam and IR sensitivity The disc is most prominent in IR and fortunately the ICX098BQ CCD chip is very good at picking up signals in IR, probably on par with or even better than some modern CCD&#039;s in this aspect. Another property of the ICX098BQ that helps here is actually the Bayer colour matrix. This is because each pixel either receives only red, green or blue light due to the overlaid Bayer matrix. But since the matrix dyes are practically transparent to IR light, every pixel therefore receives signal from the IR band. So the IR S/N ratio in the final image can be assumed to be correspondingly higher than the RGB S/N. This could easily explain why the ToUCam seems to pick up IR light so well; the Bayer matrix effectively acts like a IR pass filter and allows a proportionally higher number of pixels to be IR illuminated than RGB illuminated. While I have not tested this in practice it could mean that the limiting magnitude of the ToUCam is higher in IR than in RGB.

The subtraction technique is a great idea. I wonder if you could get even better results with an ICX618 chip, which has greater sensitivity as well as being harder to saturate ! It may reveal even more of the disk...  I love your presentation, too. The 3-d plot with the axes in au&#039;s is really cool.

Peige Wise  Guest agpvanlieshout@home.nl	29-Nov-2011 15:47 Yeahhhhhhh great, feeling must be amazing  Guest	29-Nov-2011 13:51 Dear Mr Olsen,  First: CONGRATULATION for this great image of the Beta Pictoris dust disk !!  This image remembers me when (with Guy Perrin, Alfred Vidal-Madjar, Fran&ccedil;ois Colas and others) we obtained very similar images in 1992. It was a great time. I have no doubt that this is really the disk of Beta Pic that you have in your image: its looks so similar to what we obtained. Captured with a 10&quot; telescope, your image represents a very nice achievement and a technical exploit. CONGRATULATION!!  As I wrote to a journalist asking me, I feel that it is unlikely that your image can be used to learn something new about this Beta Pictoris system. But this is not the most important: the most important is that your image is impressive and beautiful. A beautiful image of a young planetary system 62 light-years away, a beautiful image among other beautiful images in your pbase galleries.  Nonetheless, your work shows that amateur can obtain results which are potentially useful for scientists. In particular, I think about transit of exoplanets some of which can be surveyed by amateur astronomers. By the way, this gives me the opportunity to send a call for photometric survey of Beta Pictoris, which can be done by (expert) amateurs. Indeed, in 1994 we discovered that a planet likely transited in front of Beta Pictoris in 1981. In 1994, the claim for the observation of a transiting exoplanet was regarded as very suspicious. But the things have changed, and since 2008 we know that a planet orbits around Beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al. 2008), moreover the imaged planet is very consistent with a transit in 1981 (Lecavelier &amp; Vidal-Madjar 2009). To predict when the next transit will happen a survey of Beta Pictoris photometry is needed. In that regard, the help from amateur can be useful.  A comment: in contrary to the title of the photo, the Beta Pictoris disk is not &quot;protoplanetary&quot;, this is a &quot;debris disk&quot;. The dust seen in the image is not massive enough for a new planet to form. This dust is produced by collision between asteroids and/or evaporation of comets: the dusty grains captured in your photo are the debris of minor bodies orbiting in a young and active planetary system, similar to our own solar system when it was a few million years old.  Congratulation again !  Alain Lecavelier des Etangs  Guest j.berg100@chello.nl	29-Nov-2011 13:05 congratulations, Spectacular!  Guest	29-Nov-2011 10:11 I take my hat off to you sir!

        <meta itemprop="description" content="Imaging the Circumstellar Disc around Beta Pictoris with Amateur Equipment     This image shows the famous circumstellar disc of debris and dust orbiting the star Beta Pictoris 63.4 light years away. This is a very young system thought to be only around 12 million years old and is essentially similar to how our own Solar System must have formed some 4.5 billion years ago. The disc is seen edge-on from our perspective and appears in professional images as thin wedges or lines protruding radially from the central star in opposite directions. For the last couple of years I have been wondering if it was possible for amateurs to capture this special target but have never come across any such images. The main difficulty is the overwhelming glare from Beta Pictoris itself which completely drowns out the dust disc that is circling very close to the star. Images of the disc taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and from big observatories, are usually made by physically blocking out the glare of Beta Pictoris itself within the optical path. But I then found this excellent 1993 paper &#039;Observation of the central part of the beta Pictoris disk with an anti-blooming CCD&#039; (Lecavelier des Etangs, A., Perrin, G., Ferlet, R., Vidal-Madjar, A., Colas, F., et al., 1993, A&amp;A, 274, 877) Full article available here: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993A%26A...274..877L   I realised that with this technique it might not be entirely impossible to also record the debris disc with relatively modest equipment. I followed the technique described in the paper above, which basically consists of imaging Beta and then taking another image of a similar reference star under the same conditions. The two images are subtracted from each other to eliminate the stellar glare, and the dust disc should then hopefully reveal itself. However, since the two stars have different magnitudes I needed to calculate how long to expose Alpha for in order to get a similar image which I could subtract from the Beta image:   The magnitude difference between the stars is 3.86(Beta) - 3.30(Alpha) = 0.56 Due to the logarithmic nature of the magnitude scale we know that a difference of 1 magnitude equals a brightness ratio of 2.512. Therefore 2.512 to the power of the numerical magnitude difference then equals the variation in brightness. 2.5120.56 = 1.67, so it appears Alpha is 1.67 times brighter than Beta. This means that exposure for Alpha should be 1/1.67 = 0.597 times that of Beta.    With this approach I managed to capture the first amateur image of the debris disc on 16th November 2011. This image generated a lot of attention from both professional and amateur astronomers and was reported in the media all over the world.   After the initial success of capturing the disc I was contacted by several people in the astronomy community, among which were Dr Grant Christie of Auckland&#039;s Stardome Observatory. Following his suggestions I had a go at imaging it again using shorter exposures. This was to minimise the area saturated by Beta Pictoris itself and potentially reveal more of the debris disc closer to the star. The ICX098BQ chip in the ToUCam saturates fairly quickly for bright stars, even at very short exposures. Since long exposures with my ToUCam can only be controlled in 0.5s increments I decided to use 7.0s and 4.0s for Beta and Alpha respectively, which translates to a factor of 0.571. This was very close to the calculated brightness factor of 0.597 and still significantly shorter than the 30.0s I used for the first image on 16/11/2011.   So for this second image I collected 344 images of Beta Pictoris at 7.0 seconds each and 299 images of Alpha Pictoris at 4.0s each. Both sets of images were dark subtracted and stacked separately in Registax. I then subtracted the Alpha image from the Beta image in PixInsight LE, and also created the absolute difference between the two. The absolute difference image is simply easier to work with, but the subtraction image was important as a reference to examine which of the stars had contributed the various parts of the difference. Below are both the subtraction result (left) and the absolute difference (right):           In the subtraction image on the left contributions from Alpha Pictoris are dark, while contributions from Beta Pictoris are light. It is clear that there is a fairly strong signal corresponding to the exact location of the debris disc and that it is coming from the Beta image.   I created a more natural looking final image by taking the original stacked Beta image and then blending in the central parts from a stretched version of the absolute difference image that showed the dust disc. I decided to also keep the black spot of the central glare from the difference image since the contrast with the protruding disc just seems better this way. So there is no occulting disc involved, it is simply for the sake of presentation. I created a couple of versions which can be seen in the gallery below. This is a vastly better image than the first one taken on 16/11/2011. I believe the higher number of subframes (344 versus 55) coupled with the shorter exposure times are responsible for the improvement.   I used MaximDL to produce some more in-depth illustrations of what is going on in the difference image. First a area plot of the intensity immediately around Beta Pictoris. The circular plateau in the centre corresponds to the saturated area caused by Beta Pictoris itself (The narrow trough immediately surrounding it is an artifact of the image processing). The debris disc is visible as the elevated red areas on each side of the star:      And profile plots taken both through the debris disc plane and perpendicular to it. The horizontal scale is Astronomical Units and the area saturated by Beta itself is highlighted on the plots:      The visible part of the debris disc seems to extend to roughly 250-300AU before it falls below the background noise levels.  I have found that the limiting magnitude with the ToUCam from my location is around 20.0. So how far out should the debris disc theoretically be visible in my image? This is a plot of the magnitude pr. square arcsecond for the debris disc (Smith, B. A. &amp; Terrile, R. J. 1984, Science, 226, 1421 A Circumstellar Disk around Beta Pictoris):       It seems from the figure above that if a limiting magnitude of approximately 20.0 is assumed, then the debris disc should be visible out to somewhere around 250-300AU. This corresponds with what is seen in the profile plots above.    This annotated crop of the final image shows the extent of the debris disc on both sides of Beta itself:      Some notes on ToUCam and IR sensitivity The disc is most prominent in IR and fortunately the ICX098BQ CCD chip is very good at picking up signals in IR, probably on par with or even better than some modern CCD&#039;s in this aspect. Another property of the ICX098BQ that helps here is actually the Bayer colour matrix. This is because each pixel either receives only red, green or blue light due to the overlaid Bayer matrix. But since the matrix dyes are practically transparent to IR light, every pixel therefore receives signal from the IR band. So the IR S/N ratio in the final image can be assumed to be correspondingly higher than the RGB S/N. This could easily explain why the ToUCam seems to pick up IR light so well; the Bayer matrix effectively acts like a IR pass filter and allows a proportionally higher number of pixels to be IR illuminated than RGB illuminated. While I have not tested this in practice it could mean that the limiting magnitude of the ToUCam is higher in IR than in RGB.

Peige Wise  Guest agpvanlieshout@home.nl	29-Nov-2011 15:47 Yeahhhhhhh great, feeling must be amazing  Guest	29-Nov-2011 13:51 Dear Mr Olsen,  First: CONGRATULATION for this great image of the Beta Pictoris dust disk !!  This image remembers me when (with Guy Perrin, Alfred Vidal-Madjar, Fran&ccedil;ois Colas and others) we obtained very similar images in 1992. It was a great time. I have no doubt that this is really the disk of Beta Pic that you have in your image: its looks so similar to what we obtained. Captured with a 10&quot; telescope, your image represents a very nice achievement and a technical exploit. CONGRATULATION!!  As I wrote to a journalist asking me, I feel that it is unlikely that your image can be used to learn something new about this Beta Pictoris system. But this is not the most important: the most important is that your image is impressive and beautiful. A beautiful image of a young planetary system 62 light-years away, a beautiful image among other beautiful images in your pbase galleries.  Nonetheless, your work shows that amateur can obtain results which are potentially useful for scientists. In particular, I think about transit of exoplanets some of which can be surveyed by amateur astronomers. By the way, this gives me the opportunity to send a call for photometric survey of Beta Pictoris, which can be done by (expert) amateurs. Indeed, in 1994 we discovered that a planet likely transited in front of Beta Pictoris in 1981. In 1994, the claim for the observation of a transiting exoplanet was regarded as very suspicious. But the things have changed, and since 2008 we know that a planet orbits around Beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al. 2008), moreover the imaged planet is very consistent with a transit in 1981 (Lecavelier &amp; Vidal-Madjar 2009). To predict when the next transit will happen a survey of Beta Pictoris photometry is needed. In that regard, the help from amateur can be useful.  A comment: in contrary to the title of the photo, the Beta Pictoris disk is not &quot;protoplanetary&quot;, this is a &quot;debris disk&quot;. The dust seen in the image is not massive enough for a new planet to form. This dust is produced by collision between asteroids and/or evaporation of comets: the dusty grains captured in your photo are the debris of minor bodies orbiting in a young and active planetary system, similar to our own solar system when it was a few million years old.  Congratulation again !  Alain Lecavelier des Etangs  Guest j.berg100@chello.nl	29-Nov-2011 13:05 congratulations, Spectacular!  Guest	29-Nov-2011 10:11 I take my hat off to you sir!

        <meta name="description" content="Imaging the Circumstellar Disc around Beta Pictoris with Amateur Equipment     This image shows the famous circumstellar disc of debris and dust orbiting the star Beta Pictoris 63.4 light years away. This is a very young system thought to be only around 12 million years old and is essentially similar to how our own Solar System must have formed some 4.5 billion years ago. The disc is seen edge-on from our perspective and appears in professional images as thin wedges or lines protruding radially from the central star in opposite directions. For the last couple of years I have been wondering if it was possible for amateurs to capture this special target but have never come across any such images. The main difficulty is the overwhelming glare from Beta Pictoris itself which completely drowns out the dust disc that is circling very close to the star. Images of the disc taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and from big observatories, are usually made by physically blocking out the glare of Beta Pictoris itself within the optical path. But I then found this excellent 1993 paper &#039;Observation of the central part of the beta Pictoris disk with an anti-blooming CCD&#039; (Lecavelier des Etangs, A., Perrin, G., Ferlet, R., Vidal-Madjar, A., Colas, F., et al., 1993, A&amp;A, 274, 877) Full article available here: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993A%26A...274..877L   I realised that with this technique it might not be entirely impossible to also record the debris disc with relatively modest equipment. I followed the technique described in the paper above, which basically consists of imaging Beta and then taking another image of a similar reference star under the same conditions. The two images are subtracted from each other to eliminate the stellar glare, and the dust disc should then hopefully reveal itself. However, since the two stars have different magnitudes I needed to calculate how long to expose Alpha for in order to get a similar image which I could subtract from the Beta image:   The magnitude difference between the stars is 3.86(Beta) - 3.30(Alpha) = 0.56 Due to the logarithmic nature of the magnitude scale we know that a difference of 1 magnitude equals a brightness ratio of 2.512. Therefore 2.512 to the power of the numerical magnitude difference then equals the variation in brightness. 2.5120.56 = 1.67, so it appears Alpha is 1.67 times brighter than Beta. This means that exposure for Alpha should be 1/1.67 = 0.597 times that of Beta.    With this approach I managed to capture the first amateur image of the debris disc on 16th November 2011. This image generated a lot of attention from both professional and amateur astronomers and was reported in the media all over the world.   After the initial success of capturing the disc I was contacted by several people in the astronomy community, among which were Dr Grant Christie of Auckland&#039;s Stardome Observatory. Following his suggestions I had a go at imaging it again using shorter exposures. This was to minimise the area saturated by Beta Pictoris itself and potentially reveal more of the debris disc closer to the star. The ICX098BQ chip in the ToUCam saturates fairly quickly for bright stars, even at very short exposures. Since long exposures with my ToUCam can only be controlled in 0.5s increments I decided to use 7.0s and 4.0s for Beta and Alpha respectively, which translates to a factor of 0.571. This was very close to the calculated brightness factor of 0.597 and still significantly shorter than the 30.0s I used for the first image on 16/11/2011.   So for this second image I collected 344 images of Beta Pictoris at 7.0 seconds each and 299 images of Alpha Pictoris at 4.0s each. Both sets of images were dark subtracted and stacked separately in Registax. I then subtracted the Alpha image from the Beta image in PixInsight LE, and also created the absolute difference between the two. The absolute difference image is simply easier to work with, but the subtraction image was important as a reference to examine which of the stars had contributed the various parts of the difference. Below are both the subtraction result (left) and the absolute difference (right):           In the subtraction image on the left contributions from Alpha Pictoris are dark, while contributions from Beta Pictoris are light. It is clear that there is a fairly strong signal corresponding to the exact location of the debris disc and that it is coming from the Beta image.   I created a more natural looking final image by taking the original stacked Beta image and then blending in the central parts from a stretched version of the absolute difference image that showed the dust disc. I decided to also keep the black spot of the central glare from the difference image since the contrast with the protruding disc just seems better this way. So there is no occulting disc involved, it is simply for the sake of presentation. I created a couple of versions which can be seen in the gallery below. This is a vastly better image than the first one taken on 16/11/2011. I believe the higher number of subframes (344 versus 55) coupled with the shorter exposure times are responsible for the improvement.   I used MaximDL to produce some more in-depth illustrations of what is going on in the difference image. First a area plot of the intensity immediately around Beta Pictoris. The circular plateau in the centre corresponds to the saturated area caused by Beta Pictoris itself (The narrow trough immediately surrounding it is an artifact of the image processing). The debris disc is visible as the elevated red areas on each side of the star:      And profile plots taken both through the debris disc plane and perpendicular to it. The horizontal scale is Astronomical Units and the area saturated by Beta itself is highlighted on the plots:      The visible part of the debris disc seems to extend to roughly 250-300AU before it falls below the background noise levels.  I have found that the limiting magnitude with the ToUCam from my location is around 20.0. So how far out should the debris disc theoretically be visible in my image? This is a plot of the magnitude pr. square arcsecond for the debris disc (Smith, B. A. &amp; Terrile, R. J. 1984, Science, 226, 1421 A Circumstellar Disk around Beta Pictoris):       It seems from the figure above that if a limiting magnitude of approximately 20.0 is assumed, then the debris disc should be visible out to somewhere around 250-300AU. This corresponds with what is seen in the profile plots above.    This annotated crop of the final image shows the extent of the debris disc on both sides of Beta itself:      Some notes on ToUCam and IR sensitivity The disc is most prominent in IR and fortunately the ICX098BQ CCD chip is very good at picking up signals in IR, probably on par with or even better than some modern CCD&#039;s in this aspect. Another property of the ICX098BQ that helps here is actually the Bayer colour matrix. This is because each pixel either receives only red, green or blue light due to the overlaid Bayer matrix. But since the matrix dyes are practically transparent to IR light, every pixel therefore receives signal from the IR band. So the IR S/N ratio in the final image can be assumed to be correspondingly higher than the RGB S/N. This could easily explain why the ToUCam seems to pick up IR light so well; the Bayer matrix effectively acts like a IR pass filter and allows a proportionally higher number of pixels to be IR illuminated than RGB illuminated. While I have not tested this in practice it could mean that the limiting magnitude of the ToUCam is higher in IR than in RGB.

If it is not ok to post the photo please email me cleverevolution.project@gmal.com.  Thank you!  Guest	02-Dec-2011 09:37 This is so cool, I have no astronomy experience, but this just wants me to run to a store and buy a beginners telescope! ;-) Great job! KR, Ronald  Guest	02-Dec-2011 04:55 I&rsquo;m a die hard visual astronomer and this is the first time I seriously consider experimenting with astrophotography. Congratulations on such impressive achievement. (Jose from Mexico)  Guest mikew@tecca.com	01-Dec-2011 17:12 Hey Rolf, I&#039;d like permission to use your photo in a gallery I&#039;m doing for Yahoo! News about amateur astronomy. If you could get back to me ASAP that would be fantastic. Thanks so much!  -Mike  mikew@tecca.com  Guest fmarchis@seti.org	01-Dec-2011 01:30 great work!!!! I am impressed that amateur astronomer can today reach the imaging capability that we had in the 1990s. One small correction though. You did not image another solar system but another planetary system or stellar system. There is only one Sun and that&#039;s the one we see nearby Earth.  Guest astrojensen@jubii.dk	30-Nov-2011 20:26 Fantastisk! Et stort tillykke fra Danmark.  Guest	30-Nov-2011 20:24 Amazing work - Congrats  Lars  Guest chrispy50@yahoo.com	30-Nov-2011 19:23 Very cool!

Keep up the good work and I wouldn&#039;t be surprised to see your title shift from amatuer to professional astronomer!  Guest whodarep@hotmail.com	30-Nov-2011 07:43 After Gliese 581g and Proxima Centuri, Beta Pictoris should be a priorty destination when humanity masters interstellar travel:)  Congradulations man!

Guest	29-Nov-2011 21:26 Great Work Rolf. This is unbelievable.  Being an amateur and finding/imaging a solar system is way too cool.  Guest me1928@web.de	29-Nov-2011 18:48 Be proud of that. You really set a mark!!! Thanks for that great picture. Greetings from germany.  Guest	29-Nov-2011 16:32 Abolutely stunning! Brilliant!  Guest	29-Nov-2011 16:04 Awesome! Spectacular work! T. Peige Wise  Guest agpvanlieshout@home.nl	29-Nov-2011 15:47 Yeahhhhhhh great, feeling must be amazing  Guest	29-Nov-2011 13:51 Dear Mr Olsen,  First: CONGRATULATION for this great image of the Beta Pictoris dust disk !!  This image remembers me when (with Guy Perrin, Alfred Vidal-Madjar, Fran&ccedil;ois Colas and others) we obtained very similar images in 1992. It was a great time. I have no doubt that this is really the disk of Beta Pic that you have in your image: its looks so similar to what we obtained. Captured with a 10 telescope, your image represents a very nice achievement and a technical exploit. CONGRATULATION!!  As I wrote to a journalist asking me, I feel that it is unlikely that your image can be used to learn something new about this Beta Pictoris system. But this is not the most important: the most important is that your image is impressive and beautiful. A beautiful image of a young planetary system 62 light-years away, a beautiful image among other beautiful images in your pbase galleries.  Nonetheless, your work shows that amateur can obtain results which are potentially useful for scientists. In particular, I think about transit of exoplanets some of which can be surveyed by amateur astronomers. By the way, this gives me the opportunity to send a call for photometric survey of Beta Pictoris, which can be done by (expert) amateurs. Indeed, in 1994 we discovered that a planet likely transited in front of Beta Pictoris in 1981. In 1994, the claim for the observation of a transiting exoplanet was regarded as very suspicious. But the things have changed, and since 2008 we know that a planet orbits around Beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al. 2008), moreover the imaged planet is very consistent with a transit in 1981 (Lecavelier &amp; Vidal-Madjar 2009). To predict when the next transit will happen a survey of Beta Pictoris photometry is needed. In that regard, the help from amateur can be useful.  A comment: in contrary to the title of the photo, the Beta Pictoris disk is not protoplanetary, this is a debris disk. The dust seen in the image is not massive enough for a new planet to form. This dust is produced by collision between asteroids and/or evaporation of comets: the dusty grains captured in your photo are the debris of minor bodies orbiting in a young and active planetary system, similar to our own solar system when it was a few million years old.  Congratulation again !  Alain Lecavelier des Etangs  Guest j.berg100@chello.nl	29-Nov-2011 13:05 congratulations, Spectacular!  Guest	29-Nov-2011 10:11 I take my hat off to you sir!

This is a very young system thought to be only around 12 million years old and is essentially similar to how our own Solar System must have formed some 4.5 billion years ago. The disc is seen edge-on from our perspective and appears in professional images as thin wedges or lines protruding radially from the central star in opposite directions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the last couple of years I have been wondering if it was possible for amateurs to capture this special target but have never come across any such images. The main difficulty is the overwhelming glare from Beta Pictoris itself which completely drowns out the dust disc that is circling very close to the star. Images of the disc taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and from big observatories, are usually made by physically blocking out the glare of Beta Pictoris itself within the optical path.\nBut I then found this excellent 1993 paper \u0027Observation of the central part of the beta Pictoris disk with an anti-blooming CCD\u0027 (Lecavelier des Etangs, A., Perrin, G., Ferlet, R., Vidal-Madjar, A., Colas, F., et al., 1993, A\u0026A, 274, 877)\nFull article available here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1993A%26A...274..877L\u0022\u003Ehttp:\/\/adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1993A%26A...274..877L\u003C\/a\u003E\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realised that with this technique it might not be entirely impossible to also record the debris disc with relatively modest equipment. I followed the technique described in the paper above, which basically consists of imaging Beta and then taking another image of a similar reference star under the same conditions. The two images are subtracted from each other to eliminate the stellar glare, and the dust disc should then hopefully reveal itself. However, since the two stars have different magnitudes I needed to calculate how long to expose Alpha for in order to get a similar image which I could subtract from the Beta image:\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe magnitude difference between the stars is 3.86\u003Csub\u003E(Beta)\u003C\/sub\u003E - 3.30\u003Csub\u003E(Alpha)\u003C\/sub\u003E = 0.56\u003Cbr\u003E\nDue to the logarithmic nature of the magnitude scale we know that a difference of 1 magnitude equals a brightness ratio of 2.512. Therefore 2.512 to the power of the numerical magnitude difference then equals the variation in brightness.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.512\u003Csup\u003E0.56\u003C\/sup\u003E = 1.67, so it appears Alpha is 1.67 times brighter than Beta. This means that exposure for Alpha should be 1\/1.67 = 0.597 times that of Beta. \n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this approach I managed to capture the first amateur image of the debris disc on 16th November 2011. This image generated a lot of attention from both professional and amateur astronomers and was \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Publications\/25568386_qzQ6bq\u0022\u003Ereported in the media all over the world\u003C\/a\u003E.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the initial success of capturing the disc I was contacted by several people in the astronomy community, among which were Dr Grant Christie of Auckland\u0027s Stardome Observatory. Following his suggestions I had a go at imaging it again using shorter exposures. This was to minimise the area saturated by Beta Pictoris itself and potentially reveal more of the debris disc closer to the star. The ICX098BQ chip in the ToUCam saturates fairly quickly for bright stars, even at very short exposures. Since long exposures with my ToUCam can only be controlled in 0.5s increments I decided to use 7.0s and 4.0s for Beta and Alpha respectively, which translates to a factor of 0.571. This was very close to the calculated brightness factor of 0.597 and still significantly shorter than the 30.0s I used for the first image on 16\/11\/2011.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for this second image I collected 344 images of Beta Pictoris at 7.0 seconds each and 299 images of Alpha Pictoris at 4.0s each. Both sets of images were dark subtracted and stacked separately in Registax. I then subtracted the Alpha image from the Beta image in PixInsight LE, and also created the absolute difference between the two.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe absolute difference image is simply easier to work with, but the subtraction image was important as a reference to examine which of the stars had contributed the various parts of the difference. Below are both the subtraction result (left) and the absolute difference (right):\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E\n\u003Ctable\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-vsnZ8D5\/2\/X3\/Abs-difference-X3.jpg\u0022\/\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-Gbpr8KR\/2\/X3\/Beta-minus-Alpha-X3.jpg\u0022\/\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\n\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003C\/table\u003E\n\u003C\/center\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the subtraction image on the left contributions from Alpha Pictoris are dark, while contributions from Beta Pictoris are light. It is clear that there is a fairly strong signal corresponding to the exact location of the debris disc and that it is coming from the Beta image.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI created a more natural looking final image by taking the original stacked Beta image and then blending in the central parts from a stretched version of the absolute difference image that showed the dust disc. I decided to also keep the black spot of the central glare from the difference image since the contrast with the protruding disc just seems better this way. So there is no occulting disc involved, it is simply for the sake of presentation. I created a couple of versions which can be seen in the gallery below. This is a vastly better image than the first one taken on 16\/11\/2011. I believe the higher number of subframes (344 versus 55) coupled with the shorter exposure times are responsible for the improvement.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used MaximDL to produce some more in-depth illustrations of what is going on in the difference image. First a area plot of the intensity immediately around Beta Pictoris. The circular plateau in the centre corresponds to the saturated area caused by Beta Pictoris itself (The narrow trough immediately surrounding it is an artifact of the image processing). The debris disc is visible as the elevated red areas on each side of the star:\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-5fsxjwF\/2\/X3\/MaximDL-area-plot-X3.jpg\u0022\/\u003E\u003C\/center\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd profile plots taken both through the debris disc plane and perpendicular to it.

So how far out should the debris disc theoretically be visible in my image?

This is because each pixel either receives only red, green or blue light due to the overlaid Bayer matrix. But since the matrix dyes are practically transparent to IR light, every pixel therefore receives signal from the IR band. So the IR S\/N ratio in the final image can be assumed to be correspondingly higher than the RGB S\/N. This could easily explain why the ToUCam seems to pick up IR light so well; the Bayer matrix effectively acts like a IR pass filter and allows a proportionally higher number of pixels to be IR illuminated than RGB illuminated.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile I have not tested this in practice it could mean that the limiting magnitude of the ToUCam is higher in IR than in RGB.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003ERolf Wahl Olsen, 04\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C\/sup\u003E December 2011\u003C\/i\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EComments:\u003C\/h2\u003E\nI received a lot of kind and encouraging comments on my old site (\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.pbase.com\/rolfolsen\u0022\u003Ehttp:\/\/www.pbase.com\/rolfolsen\u003C\/a\u003E) about this image, so I have copied these comments below:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E(If you would like to leave a new comment please feel free to do so via the button at the very bottom of this page)\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003Eikkaisei\t09-Aug-2012 21:15\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EThis is encouraging work - what an effort.\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERob Craftsman\t01-Aug-2012 21:39\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFor a self-proclaimed first amateur (are you sure?? this is really good) pic of another solar system, this is really stunning.

It was a great time. I have no doubt that this is really the disk of Beta Pic that you have in your image: its looks so similar to what we obtained. Captured with a 10\u0022 telescope, your image represents a very nice achievement and a technical exploit. CONGRATULATION!! \n\u003Cbr\u003EAs I wrote to a journalist asking me, I feel that it is unlikely that your image can be used to learn something new about this Beta Pictoris system. But this is not the most important: the most important is that your image is impressive and beautiful. A beautiful image of a young planetary system 62 light-years away, a beautiful image among other beautiful images in your pbase galleries. \n\u003Cbr\u003ENonetheless, your work shows that amateur can obtain results which are potentially useful for scientists. In particular, I think about transit of exoplanets some of which can be surveyed by amateur astronomers. By the way, this gives me the opportunity to send a call for photometric survey of Beta Pictoris, which can be done by (expert) amateurs. Indeed, in 1994 we discovered that a planet likely transited in front of Beta Pictoris in 1981. In 1994, the claim for the observation of a transiting exoplanet was regarded as very suspicious. But the things have changed, and since 2008 we know that a planet orbits around Beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al. 2008), moreover the imaged planet is very consistent with a transit in 1981 (Lecavelier \u0026 Vidal-Madjar 2009). To predict when the next transit will happen a survey of Beta Pictoris photometry is needed. In that regard, the help from amateur can be useful. \n\u003Cbr\u003EA comment: in contrary to the title of the photo, the Beta Pictoris disk is not \u0022protoplanetary\u0022, this is a \u0022debris disk\u0022. The dust seen in the image is not massive enough for a new planet to form. This dust is produced by collision between asteroids and\/or evaporation of comets: the dusty grains captured in your photo are the debris of minor bodies orbiting in a young and active planetary system, similar to our own solar system when it was a few million years old. \n\u003Cbr\u003ECongratulation again ! \n\u003Cbr\u003EAlain Lecavelier des Etangs\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003EGuest j.berg100@chello.nl\t29-Nov-2011 13:05\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Econgratulations, Spectacular!\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003EGuest\t29-Nov-2011 10:11\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI take my hat off to you sir!

This is a very young system thought to be only around 12 million years old and is essentially similar to how our own Solar System must have formed some 4.5 billion years ago. The disc is seen edge-on from our perspective and appears in professional images as thin wedges or lines protruding radially from the central star in opposite directions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the last couple of years I have been wondering if it was possible for amateurs to capture this special target but have never come across any such images. The main difficulty is the overwhelming glare from Beta Pictoris itself which completely drowns out the dust disc that is circling very close to the star. Images of the disc taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and from big observatories, are usually made by physically blocking out the glare of Beta Pictoris itself within the optical path.\nBut I then found this excellent 1993 paper \u0027Observation of the central part of the beta Pictoris disk with an anti-blooming CCD\u0027 (Lecavelier des Etangs, A., Perrin, G., Ferlet, R., Vidal-Madjar, A., Colas, F., et al., 1993, A\u0026amp;A, 274, 877)\nFull article available here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1993A%26A...274..877L\u0022\u003Ehttp:\/\/adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1993A%26A...274..877L\u003C\/a\u003E\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realised that with this technique it might not be entirely impossible to also record the debris disc with relatively modest equipment. I followed the technique described in the paper above, which basically consists of imaging Beta and then taking another image of a similar reference star under the same conditions. The two images are subtracted from each other to eliminate the stellar glare, and the dust disc should then hopefully reveal itself. However, since the two stars have different magnitudes I needed to calculate how long to expose Alpha for in order to get a similar image which I could subtract from the Beta image:\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe magnitude difference between the stars is 3.86\u003Csub\u003E(Beta)\u003C\/sub\u003E - 3.30\u003Csub\u003E(Alpha)\u003C\/sub\u003E = 0.56\u003Cbr\u003E\nDue to the logarithmic nature of the magnitude scale we know that a difference of 1 magnitude equals a brightness ratio of 2.512. Therefore 2.512 to the power of the numerical magnitude difference then equals the variation in brightness.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.512\u003Csup\u003E0.56\u003C\/sup\u003E = 1.67, so it appears Alpha is 1.67 times brighter than Beta. This means that exposure for Alpha should be 1\/1.67 = 0.597 times that of Beta. \n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this approach I managed to capture the first amateur image of the debris disc on 16th November 2011. This image generated a lot of attention from both professional and amateur astronomers and was \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Publications\/25568386_qzQ6bq\u0022\u003Ereported in the media all over the world\u003C\/a\u003E.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the initial success of capturing the disc I was contacted by several people in the astronomy community, among which were Dr Grant Christie of Auckland\u0027s Stardome Observatory. Following his suggestions I had a go at imaging it again using shorter exposures. This was to minimise the area saturated by Beta Pictoris itself and potentially reveal more of the debris disc closer to the star. The ICX098BQ chip in the ToUCam saturates fairly quickly for bright stars, even at very short exposures. Since long exposures with my ToUCam can only be controlled in 0.5s increments I decided to use 7.0s and 4.0s for Beta and Alpha respectively, which translates to a factor of 0.571. This was very close to the calculated brightness factor of 0.597 and still significantly shorter than the 30.0s I used for the first image on 16\/11\/2011.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for this second image I collected 344 images of Beta Pictoris at 7.0 seconds each and 299 images of Alpha Pictoris at 4.0s each. Both sets of images were dark subtracted and stacked separately in Registax. I then subtracted the Alpha image from the Beta image in PixInsight LE, and also created the absolute difference between the two.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe absolute difference image is simply easier to work with, but the subtraction image was important as a reference to examine which of the stars had contributed the various parts of the difference. Below are both the subtraction result (left) and the absolute difference (right):\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E\n\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-vsnZ8D5\/2\/X3\/Abs-difference-X3.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-Gbpr8KR\/2\/X3\/Beta-minus-Alpha-X3.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\n\u003C\/center\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the subtraction image on the left contributions from Alpha Pictoris are dark, while contributions from Beta Pictoris are light. It is clear that there is a fairly strong signal corresponding to the exact location of the debris disc and that it is coming from the Beta image.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI created a more natural looking final image by taking the original stacked Beta image and then blending in the central parts from a stretched version of the absolute difference image that showed the dust disc. I decided to also keep the black spot of the central glare from the difference image since the contrast with the protruding disc just seems better this way. So there is no occulting disc involved, it is simply for the sake of presentation. I created a couple of versions which can be seen in the gallery below. This is a vastly better image than the first one taken on 16\/11\/2011. I believe the higher number of subframes (344 versus 55) coupled with the shorter exposure times are responsible for the improvement.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used MaximDL to produce some more in-depth illustrations of what is going on in the difference image. First a area plot of the intensity immediately around Beta Pictoris. The circular plateau in the centre corresponds to the saturated area caused by Beta Pictoris itself (The narrow trough immediately surrounding it is an artifact of the image processing). The debris disc is visible as the elevated red areas on each side of the star:\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-5fsxjwF\/2\/X3\/MaximDL-area-plot-X3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C\/center\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd profile plots taken both through the debris disc plane and perpendicular to it. The horizontal scale is Astronomical Units and the area saturated by Beta itself is highlighted on the plots:\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-f8Rgkwc\/2\/X3\/Profile-presentation-noframes-X3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C\/center\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe visible part of the debris disc seems to extend to roughly 250-300AU before it falls below the background noise levels. \nI have found that the limiting magnitude with the ToUCam from my location is around 20.0. So how far out should the debris disc theoretically be visible in my image?

This is because each pixel either receives only red, green or blue light due to the overlaid Bayer matrix. But since the matrix dyes are practically transparent to IR light, every pixel therefore receives signal from the IR band. So the IR S\/N ratio in the final image can be assumed to be correspondingly higher than the RGB S\/N. This could easily explain why the ToUCam seems to pick up IR light so well; the Bayer matrix effectively acts like a IR pass filter and allows a proportionally higher number of pixels to be IR illuminated than RGB illuminated.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile I have not tested this in practice it could mean that the limiting magnitude of the ToUCam is higher in IR than in RGB.\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003ERolf Wahl Olsen, 04\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C\/sup\u003E December 2011\u003C\/i\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EComments:\u003C\/h2\u003E\nI received a lot of kind and encouraging comments on my old site (\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.pbase.com\/rolfolsen\u0022\u003Ehttp:\/\/www.pbase.com\/rolfolsen\u003C\/a\u003E) about this image, so I have copied these comments below:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E(If you would like to leave a new comment please feel free to do so via the button at the very bottom of this page)\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003Eikkaisei\t09-Aug-2012 21:15\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EThis is encouraging work - what an effort.\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERob Craftsman\t01-Aug-2012 21:39\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFor a self-proclaimed first amateur (are you sure?? this is really good) pic of another solar system, this is really stunning.

It was a great time. I have no doubt that this is really the disk of Beta Pic that you have in your image: its looks so similar to what we obtained. Captured with a 10\u0022 telescope, your image represents a very nice achievement and a technical exploit. CONGRATULATION!! \n\u003Cbr\u003EAs I wrote to a journalist asking me, I feel that it is unlikely that your image can be used to learn something new about this Beta Pictoris system. But this is not the most important: the most important is that your image is impressive and beautiful. A beautiful image of a young planetary system 62 light-years away, a beautiful image among other beautiful images in your pbase galleries. \n\u003Cbr\u003ENonetheless, your work shows that amateur can obtain results which are potentially useful for scientists. In particular, I think about transit of exoplanets some of which can be surveyed by amateur astronomers. By the way, this gives me the opportunity to send a call for photometric survey of Beta Pictoris, which can be done by (expert) amateurs. Indeed, in 1994 we discovered that a planet likely transited in front of Beta Pictoris in 1981. In 1994, the claim for the observation of a transiting exoplanet was regarded as very suspicious. But the things have changed, and since 2008 we know that a planet orbits around Beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al. 2008), moreover the imaged planet is very consistent with a transit in 1981 (Lecavelier \u0026amp; Vidal-Madjar 2009). To predict when the next transit will happen a survey of Beta Pictoris photometry is needed. In that regard, the help from amateur can be useful. \n\u003Cbr\u003EA comment: in contrary to the title of the photo, the Beta Pictoris disk is not \u0022protoplanetary\u0022, this is a \u0022debris disk\u0022. The dust seen in the image is not massive enough for a new planet to form. This dust is produced by collision between asteroids and\/or evaporation of comets: the dusty grains captured in your photo are the debris of minor bodies orbiting in a young and active planetary system, similar to our own solar system when it was a few million years old. \n\u003Cbr\u003ECongratulation again ! \n\u003Cbr\u003EAlain Lecavelier des Etangs\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003EGuest j.berg100@chello.nl\t29-Nov-2011 13:05\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Econgratulations, Spectacular!\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003EGuest\t29-Nov-2011 10:11\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI take my hat off to you sir!

This is a very young system thought to be only around 12 million years old and is essentially similar to how our own Solar System must have formed some 4.5 billion years ago. The disc is seen edge-on from our perspective and appears in professional images as thin wedges or lines protruding radially from the central star in opposite directions.\nFor the last couple of years I have been wondering if it was possible for amateurs to capture this special target but have never come across any such images. The main difficulty is the overwhelming glare from Beta Pictoris itself which completely drowns out the dust disc that is circling very close to the star. Images of the disc taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and from big observatories, are usually made by physically blocking out the glare of Beta Pictoris itself within the optical path.\nBut I then found this excellent 1993 paper \u0027Observation of the central part of the beta Pictoris disk with an anti-blooming CCD\u0027 (Lecavelier des Etangs, A., Perrin, G., Ferlet, R., Vidal-Madjar, A., Colas, F., et al., 1993, A\u0026amp;A, 274, 877)\nFull article available here: http:\/\/adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1993A%26A...274..877L\n\n\nI realised that with this technique it might not be entirely impossible to also record the debris disc with relatively modest equipment. I followed the technique described in the paper above, which basically consists of imaging Beta and then taking another image of a similar reference star under the same conditions. The two images are subtracted from each other to eliminate the stellar glare, and the dust disc should then hopefully reveal itself. However, since the two stars have different magnitudes I needed to calculate how long to expose Alpha for in order to get a similar image which I could subtract from the Beta image:\n\n\nThe magnitude difference between the stars is 3.86(Beta) - 3.30(Alpha) = 0.56\nDue to the logarithmic nature of the magnitude scale we know that a difference of 1 magnitude equals a brightness ratio of 2.512. Therefore 2.512 to the power of the numerical magnitude difference then equals the variation in brightness.\n2.5120.56 = 1.67, so it appears Alpha is 1.67 times brighter than Beta. This means that exposure for Alpha should be 1\/1.67 = 0.597 times that of Beta. \n\n\nWith this approach I managed to capture the first amateur image of the debris disc on 16th November 2011. This image generated a lot of attention from both professional and amateur astronomers and was reported in the media all over the world.\n\n\nAfter the initial success of capturing the disc I was contacted by several people in the astronomy community, among which were Dr Grant Christie of Auckland\u0027s Stardome Observatory. Following his suggestions I had a go at imaging it again using shorter exposures. This was to minimise the area saturated by Beta Pictoris itself and potentially reveal more of the debris disc closer to the star. The ICX098BQ chip in the ToUCam saturates fairly quickly for bright stars, even at very short exposures. Since long exposures with my ToUCam can only be controlled in 0.5s increments I decided to use 7.0s and 4.0s for Beta and Alpha respectively, which translates to a factor of 0.571. This was very close to the calculated brightness factor of 0.597 and still significantly shorter than the 30.0s I used for the first image on 16\/11\/2011.\n\n\nSo for this second image I collected 344 images of Beta Pictoris at 7.0 seconds each and 299 images of Alpha Pictoris at 4.0s each. Both sets of images were dark subtracted and stacked separately in Registax. I then subtracted the Alpha image from the Beta image in PixInsight LE, and also created the absolute difference between the two.\nThe absolute difference image is simply easier to work with, but the subtraction image was important as a reference to examine which of the stars had contributed the various parts of the difference. Below are both the subtraction result (left) and the absolute difference (right):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the subtraction image on the left contributions from Alpha Pictoris are dark, while contributions from Beta Pictoris are light. It is clear that there is a fairly strong signal corresponding to the exact location of the debris disc and that it is coming from the Beta image.\n\n\nI created a more natural looking final image by taking the original stacked Beta image and then blending in the central parts from a stretched version of the absolute difference image that showed the dust disc. I decided to also keep the black spot of the central glare from the difference image since the contrast with the protruding disc just seems better this way. So there is no occulting disc involved, it is simply for the sake of presentation. I created a couple of versions which can be seen in the gallery below. This is a vastly better image than the first one taken on 16\/11\/2011. I believe the higher number of subframes (344 versus 55) coupled with the shorter exposure times are responsible for the improvement.\n\n\nI used MaximDL to produce some more in-depth illustrations of what is going on in the difference image. First a area plot of the intensity immediately around Beta Pictoris. The circular plateau in the centre corresponds to the saturated area caused by Beta Pictoris itself (The narrow trough immediately surrounding it is an artifact of the image processing). The debris disc is visible as the elevated red areas on each side of the star:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd profile plots taken both through the debris disc plane and perpendicular to it. The horizontal scale is Astronomical Units and the area saturated by Beta itself is highlighted on the plots:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visible part of the debris disc seems to extend to roughly 250-300AU before it falls below the background noise levels. \nI have found that the limiting magnitude with the ToUCam from my location is around 20.0. So how far out should the debris disc theoretically be visible in my image? This is a plot of the magnitude pr. square arcsecond for the debris disc (Smith, B. A. \u0026amp; Terrile, R. J. 1984, Science, 226, 1421 A Circumstellar Disk around Beta Pictoris): \n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems from the figure above that if a limiting magnitude of approximately 20.0 is assumed, then the debris disc should be visible out to somewhere around 250-300AU. This corresponds with what is seen in the profile plots above. \n\n\nThis annotated crop of the final image shows the extent of the debris disc on both sides of Beta itself:\n\n\n\n\n\nSome notes on ToUCam and IR sensitivity\nThe disc is most prominent in IR and fortunately the ICX098BQ CCD chip is very good at picking up signals in IR, probably on par with or even better than some modern CCD\u0027s in this aspect.\nAnother property of the ICX098BQ that helps here is actually the Bayer colour matrix. This is because each pixel either receives only red, green or blue light due to the overlaid Bayer matrix. But since the matrix dyes are practically transparent to IR light, every pixel therefore receives signal from the IR band. So the IR S\/N ratio in the final image can be assumed to be correspondingly higher than the RGB S\/N. This could easily explain why the ToUCam seems to pick up IR light so well; the Bayer matrix effectively acts like a IR pass filter and allows a proportionally higher number of pixels to be IR illuminated than RGB illuminated.\nWhile I have not tested this in practice it could mean that the limiting magnitude of the ToUCam is higher in IR than in RGB.\n\n\nRolf Wahl Olsen, 04th December 2011\n\n\n\nComments:\nI received a lot of kind and encouraging comments on my old site (http:\/\/www.pbase.com\/rolfolsen) about this image, so I have copied these comments below:\n(If you would like to leave a new comment please feel free to do so via the button at the very bottom of this page)\n\n\nikkaisei\t09-Aug-2012 21:15\nThis is encouraging work - what an effort.\n\nRob Craftsman\t01-Aug-2012 21:39\nFor a self-proclaimed first amateur (are you sure?? this is really good) pic of another solar system, this is really stunning.

The subtraction technique is a great idea. I wonder if you could get even better results with an ICX618 chip, which has greater sensitivity as well as being harder to saturate ! It may reveal even more of the disk... \nI love your presentation, too.

Peige Wise\n\nGuest agpvanlieshout@home.nl\t29-Nov-2011 15:47\nYeahhhhhhh great, feeling must be amazing\n\nGuest\t29-Nov-2011 13:51\nDear Mr Olsen, \nFirst: CONGRATULATION for this great image of the Beta Pictoris dust disk !! \nThis image remembers me when (with Guy Perrin, Alfred Vidal-Madjar, Fran\u00e7ois Colas and others) we obtained very similar images in 1992. It was a great time. I have no doubt that this is really the disk of Beta Pic that you have in your image: its looks so similar to what we obtained. Captured with a 10\u0022 telescope, your image represents a very nice achievement and a technical exploit. CONGRATULATION!! \nAs I wrote to a journalist asking me, I feel that it is unlikely that your image can be used to learn something new about this Beta Pictoris system. But this is not the most important: the most important is that your image is impressive and beautiful. A beautiful image of a young planetary system 62 light-years away, a beautiful image among other beautiful images in your pbase galleries. \nNonetheless, your work shows that amateur can obtain results which are potentially useful for scientists. In particular, I think about transit of exoplanets some of which can be surveyed by amateur astronomers. By the way, this gives me the opportunity to send a call for photometric survey of Beta Pictoris, which can be done by (expert) amateurs. Indeed, in 1994 we discovered that a planet likely transited in front of Beta Pictoris in 1981. In 1994, the claim for the observation of a transiting exoplanet was regarded as very suspicious. But the things have changed, and since 2008 we know that a planet orbits around Beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al. 2008), moreover the imaged planet is very consistent with a transit in 1981 (Lecavelier \u0026amp; Vidal-Madjar 2009). To predict when the next transit will happen a survey of Beta Pictoris photometry is needed. In that regard, the help from amateur can be useful. \nA comment: in contrary to the title of the photo, the Beta Pictoris disk is not \u0022protoplanetary\u0022, this is a \u0022debris disk\u0022. The dust seen in the image is not massive enough for a new planet to form. This dust is produced by collision between asteroids and\/or evaporation of comets: the dusty grains captured in your photo are the debris of minor bodies orbiting in a young and active planetary system, similar to our own solar system when it was a few million years old. \nCongratulation again ! \nAlain Lecavelier des Etangs\n\nGuest j.berg100@chello.nl\t29-Nov-2011 13:05\ncongratulations, Spectacular!\n\nGuest\t29-Nov-2011 10:11\nI take my hat off to you sir!

This is a very young system thought to be only around 12 million years old and is essentially similar to how our own Solar System must have formed some 4.5 billion years ago. The disc is seen edge-on from our perspective and appears in professional images as thin wedges or lines protruding radially from the central star in opposite directions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the last couple of years I have been wondering if it was possible for amateurs to capture this special target but have never come across any such images. The main difficulty is the overwhelming glare from Beta Pictoris itself which completely drowns out the dust disc that is circling very close to the star. Images of the disc taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and from big observatories, are usually made by physically blocking out the glare of Beta Pictoris itself within the optical path.\nBut I then found this excellent 1993 paper \u0027Observation of the central part of the beta Pictoris disk with an anti-blooming CCD\u0027 (Lecavelier des Etangs, A., Perrin, G., Ferlet, R., Vidal-Madjar, A., Colas, F., et al., 1993, A\u0026A, 274, 877)\nFull article available here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1993A%26A...274..877L\u0022\u003Ehttp:\/\/adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1993A%26A...274..877L\u003C\/a\u003E\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realised that with this technique it might not be entirely impossible to also record the debris disc with relatively modest equipment. I followed the technique described in the paper above, which basically consists of imaging Beta and then taking another image of a similar reference star under the same conditions. The two images are subtracted from each other to eliminate the stellar glare, and the dust disc should then hopefully reveal itself. However, since the two stars have different magnitudes I needed to calculate how long to expose Alpha for in order to get a similar image which I could subtract from the Beta image:\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe magnitude difference between the stars is 3.86\u003Csub\u003E(Beta)\u003C\/sub\u003E - 3.30\u003Csub\u003E(Alpha)\u003C\/sub\u003E = 0.56\u003Cbr\u003E\nDue to the logarithmic nature of the magnitude scale we know that a difference of 1 magnitude equals a brightness ratio of 2.512. Therefore 2.512 to the power of the numerical magnitude difference then equals the variation in brightness.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.512\u003Csup\u003E0.56\u003C\/sup\u003E = 1.67, so it appears Alpha is 1.67 times brighter than Beta. This means that exposure for Alpha should be 1\/1.67 = 0.597 times that of Beta. \n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this approach I managed to capture the first amateur image of the debris disc on 16th November 2011. This image generated a lot of attention from both professional and amateur astronomers and was \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Publications\/25568386_qzQ6bq\u0022\u003Ereported in the media all over the world\u003C\/a\u003E.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the initial success of capturing the disc I was contacted by several people in the astronomy community, among which were Dr Grant Christie of Auckland\u0027s Stardome Observatory. Following his suggestions I had a go at imaging it again using shorter exposures. This was to minimise the area saturated by Beta Pictoris itself and potentially reveal more of the debris disc closer to the star. The ICX098BQ chip in the ToUCam saturates fairly quickly for bright stars, even at very short exposures. Since long exposures with my ToUCam can only be controlled in 0.5s increments I decided to use 7.0s and 4.0s for Beta and Alpha respectively, which translates to a factor of 0.571. This was very close to the calculated brightness factor of 0.597 and still significantly shorter than the 30.0s I used for the first image on 16\/11\/2011.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for this second image I collected 344 images of Beta Pictoris at 7.0 seconds each and 299 images of Alpha Pictoris at 4.0s each. Both sets of images were dark subtracted and stacked separately in Registax. I then subtracted the Alpha image from the Beta image in PixInsight LE, and also created the absolute difference between the two.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe absolute difference image is simply easier to work with, but the subtraction image was important as a reference to examine which of the stars had contributed the various parts of the difference. Below are both the subtraction result (left) and the absolute difference (right):\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E\n\u003Ctable\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-vsnZ8D5\/2\/X3\/Abs-difference-X3.jpg\u0022\/\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-Gbpr8KR\/2\/X3\/Beta-minus-Alpha-X3.jpg\u0022\/\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\n\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003C\/table\u003E\n\u003C\/center\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the subtraction image on the left contributions from Alpha Pictoris are dark, while contributions from Beta Pictoris are light. It is clear that there is a fairly strong signal corresponding to the exact location of the debris disc and that it is coming from the Beta image.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI created a more natural looking final image by taking the original stacked Beta image and then blending in the central parts from a stretched version of the absolute difference image that showed the dust disc. I decided to also keep the black spot of the central glare from the difference image since the contrast with the protruding disc just seems better this way. So there is no occulting disc involved, it is simply for the sake of presentation. I created a couple of versions which can be seen in the gallery below. This is a vastly better image than the first one taken on 16\/11\/2011. I believe the higher number of subframes (344 versus 55) coupled with the shorter exposure times are responsible for the improvement.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used MaximDL to produce some more in-depth illustrations of what is going on in the difference image. First a area plot of the intensity immediately around Beta Pictoris. The circular plateau in the centre corresponds to the saturated area caused by Beta Pictoris itself (The narrow trough immediately surrounding it is an artifact of the image processing). The debris disc is visible as the elevated red areas on each side of the star:\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-5fsxjwF\/2\/X3\/MaximDL-area-plot-X3.jpg\u0022\/\u003E\u003C\/center\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd profile plots taken both through the debris disc plane and perpendicular to it.

So how far out should the debris disc theoretically be visible in my image?

This is because each pixel either receives only red, green or blue light due to the overlaid Bayer matrix. But since the matrix dyes are practically transparent to IR light, every pixel therefore receives signal from the IR band. So the IR S\/N ratio in the final image can be assumed to be correspondingly higher than the RGB S\/N. This could easily explain why the ToUCam seems to pick up IR light so well; the Bayer matrix effectively acts like a IR pass filter and allows a proportionally higher number of pixels to be IR illuminated than RGB illuminated.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile I have not tested this in practice it could mean that the limiting magnitude of the ToUCam is higher in IR than in RGB.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003ERolf Wahl Olsen, 04\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C\/sup\u003E December 2011\u003C\/i\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EComments:\u003C\/h2\u003E\nI received a lot of kind and encouraging comments on my old site (\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.pbase.com\/rolfolsen\u0022\u003Ehttp:\/\/www.pbase.com\/rolfolsen\u003C\/a\u003E) about this image, so I have copied these comments below:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E(If you would like to leave a new comment please feel free to do so via the button at the very bottom of this page)\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003Eikkaisei\t09-Aug-2012 21:15\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EThis is encouraging work - what an effort.\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERob Craftsman\t01-Aug-2012 21:39\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFor a self-proclaimed first amateur (are you sure?? this is really good) pic of another solar system, this is really stunning.

It was a great time. I have no doubt that this is really the disk of Beta Pic that you have in your image: its looks so similar to what we obtained. Captured with a 10\u0022 telescope, your image represents a very nice achievement and a technical exploit. CONGRATULATION!! \n\u003Cbr\u003EAs I wrote to a journalist asking me, I feel that it is unlikely that your image can be used to learn something new about this Beta Pictoris system. But this is not the most important: the most important is that your image is impressive and beautiful. A beautiful image of a young planetary system 62 light-years away, a beautiful image among other beautiful images in your pbase galleries. \n\u003Cbr\u003ENonetheless, your work shows that amateur can obtain results which are potentially useful for scientists. In particular, I think about transit of exoplanets some of which can be surveyed by amateur astronomers. By the way, this gives me the opportunity to send a call for photometric survey of Beta Pictoris, which can be done by (expert) amateurs. Indeed, in 1994 we discovered that a planet likely transited in front of Beta Pictoris in 1981. In 1994, the claim for the observation of a transiting exoplanet was regarded as very suspicious. But the things have changed, and since 2008 we know that a planet orbits around Beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al. 2008), moreover the imaged planet is very consistent with a transit in 1981 (Lecavelier \u0026 Vidal-Madjar 2009). To predict when the next transit will happen a survey of Beta Pictoris photometry is needed. In that regard, the help from amateur can be useful. \n\u003Cbr\u003EA comment: in contrary to the title of the photo, the Beta Pictoris disk is not \u0022protoplanetary\u0022, this is a \u0022debris disk\u0022. The dust seen in the image is not massive enough for a new planet to form. This dust is produced by collision between asteroids and\/or evaporation of comets: the dusty grains captured in your photo are the debris of minor bodies orbiting in a young and active planetary system, similar to our own solar system when it was a few million years old. \n\u003Cbr\u003ECongratulation again ! \n\u003Cbr\u003EAlain Lecavelier des Etangs\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003EGuest j.berg100@chello.nl\t29-Nov-2011 13:05\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Econgratulations, Spectacular!\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003EGuest\t29-Nov-2011 10:11\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI take my hat off to you sir!

This is a very young system thought to be only around 12 million years old and is essentially similar to how our own Solar System must have formed some 4.5 billion years ago. The disc is seen edge-on from our perspective and appears in professional images as thin wedges or lines protruding radially from the central star in opposite directions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the last couple of years I have been wondering if it was possible for amateurs to capture this special target but have never come across any such images. The main difficulty is the overwhelming glare from Beta Pictoris itself which completely drowns out the dust disc that is circling very close to the star. Images of the disc taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and from big observatories, are usually made by physically blocking out the glare of Beta Pictoris itself within the optical path.\nBut I then found this excellent 1993 paper \u0027Observation of the central part of the beta Pictoris disk with an anti-blooming CCD\u0027 (Lecavelier des Etangs, A., Perrin, G., Ferlet, R., Vidal-Madjar, A., Colas, F., et al., 1993, A\u0026A, 274, 877)\nFull article available here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1993A%26A...274..877L\u0022\u003Ehttp:\/\/adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1993A%26A...274..877L\u003C\/a\u003E\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realised that with this technique it might not be entirely impossible to also record the debris disc with relatively modest equipment. I followed the technique described in the paper above, which basically consists of imaging Beta and then taking another image of a similar reference star under the same conditions. The two images are subtracted from each other to eliminate the stellar glare, and the dust disc should then hopefully reveal itself. However, since the two stars have different magnitudes I needed to calculate how long to expose Alpha for in order to get a similar image which I could subtract from the Beta image:\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe magnitude difference between the stars is 3.86\u003Csub\u003E(Beta)\u003C\/sub\u003E - 3.30\u003Csub\u003E(Alpha)\u003C\/sub\u003E = 0.56\u003Cbr\u003E\nDue to the logarithmic nature of the magnitude scale we know that a difference of 1 magnitude equals a brightness ratio of 2.512. Therefore 2.512 to the power of the numerical magnitude difference then equals the variation in brightness.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.512\u003Csup\u003E0.56\u003C\/sup\u003E = 1.67, so it appears Alpha is 1.67 times brighter than Beta. This means that exposure for Alpha should be 1\/1.67 = 0.597 times that of Beta. \n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this approach I managed to capture the first amateur image of the debris disc on 16th November 2011. This image generated a lot of attention from both professional and amateur astronomers and was \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Publications\/25568386_qzQ6bq\u0022\u003Ereported in the media all over the world\u003C\/a\u003E.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the initial success of capturing the disc I was contacted by several people in the astronomy community, among which were Dr Grant Christie of Auckland\u0027s Stardome Observatory. Following his suggestions I had a go at imaging it again using shorter exposures. This was to minimise the area saturated by Beta Pictoris itself and potentially reveal more of the debris disc closer to the star. The ICX098BQ chip in the ToUCam saturates fairly quickly for bright stars, even at very short exposures. Since long exposures with my ToUCam can only be controlled in 0.5s increments I decided to use 7.0s and 4.0s for Beta and Alpha respectively, which translates to a factor of 0.571. This was very close to the calculated brightness factor of 0.597 and still significantly shorter than the 30.0s I used for the first image on 16\/11\/2011.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for this second image I collected 344 images of Beta Pictoris at 7.0 seconds each and 299 images of Alpha Pictoris at 4.0s each. Both sets of images were dark subtracted and stacked separately in Registax. I then subtracted the Alpha image from the Beta image in PixInsight LE, and also created the absolute difference between the two.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe absolute difference image is simply easier to work with, but the subtraction image was important as a reference to examine which of the stars had contributed the various parts of the difference. Below are both the subtraction result (left) and the absolute difference (right):\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E\n\u003Ctable\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-vsnZ8D5\/2\/X3\/Abs-difference-X3.jpg\u0022\/\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-Gbpr8KR\/2\/X3\/Beta-minus-Alpha-X3.jpg\u0022\/\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\n\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003C\/table\u003E\n\u003C\/center\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the subtraction image on the left contributions from Alpha Pictoris are dark, while contributions from Beta Pictoris are light. It is clear that there is a fairly strong signal corresponding to the exact location of the debris disc and that it is coming from the Beta image.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI created a more natural looking final image by taking the original stacked Beta image and then blending in the central parts from a stretched version of the absolute difference image that showed the dust disc. I decided to also keep the black spot of the central glare from the difference image since the contrast with the protruding disc just seems better this way. So there is no occulting disc involved, it is simply for the sake of presentation. I created a couple of versions which can be seen in the gallery below. This is a vastly better image than the first one taken on 16\/11\/2011. I believe the higher number of subframes (344 versus 55) coupled with the shorter exposure times are responsible for the improvement.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used MaximDL to produce some more in-depth illustrations of what is going on in the difference image. First a area plot of the intensity immediately around Beta Pictoris. The circular plateau in the centre corresponds to the saturated area caused by Beta Pictoris itself (The narrow trough immediately surrounding it is an artifact of the image processing). The debris disc is visible as the elevated red areas on each side of the star:\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-5fsxjwF\/2\/X3\/MaximDL-area-plot-X3.jpg\u0022\/\u003E\u003C\/center\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd profile plots taken both through the debris disc plane and perpendicular to it.

So how far out should the debris disc theoretically be visible in my image?

This is because each pixel either receives only red, green or blue light due to the overlaid Bayer matrix. But since the matrix dyes are practically transparent to IR light, every pixel therefore receives signal from the IR band. So the IR S\/N ratio in the final image can be assumed to be correspondingly higher than the RGB S\/N. This could easily explain why the ToUCam seems to pick up IR light so well; the Bayer matrix effectively acts like a IR pass filter and allows a proportionally higher number of pixels to be IR illuminated than RGB illuminated.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile I have not tested this in practice it could mean that the limiting magnitude of the ToUCam is higher in IR than in RGB.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003ERolf Wahl Olsen, 04\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C\/sup\u003E December 2011\u003C\/i\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EComments:\u003C\/h2\u003E\nI received a lot of kind and encouraging comments on my old site (\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.pbase.com\/rolfolsen\u0022\u003Ehttp:\/\/www.pbase.com\/rolfolsen\u003C\/a\u003E) about this image, so I have copied these comments below:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E(If you would like to leave a new comment please feel free to do so via the button at the very bottom of this page)\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003Eikkaisei\t09-Aug-2012 21:15\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EThis is encouraging work - what an effort.\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERob Craftsman\t01-Aug-2012 21:39\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFor a self-proclaimed first amateur (are you sure?? this is really good) pic of another solar system, this is really stunning.

It was a great time. I have no doubt that this is really the disk of Beta Pic that you have in your image: its looks so similar to what we obtained. Captured with a 10\u0022 telescope, your image represents a very nice achievement and a technical exploit. CONGRATULATION!! \n\u003Cbr\u003EAs I wrote to a journalist asking me, I feel that it is unlikely that your image can be used to learn something new about this Beta Pictoris system. But this is not the most important: the most important is that your image is impressive and beautiful. A beautiful image of a young planetary system 62 light-years away, a beautiful image among other beautiful images in your pbase galleries. \n\u003Cbr\u003ENonetheless, your work shows that amateur can obtain results which are potentially useful for scientists. In particular, I think about transit of exoplanets some of which can be surveyed by amateur astronomers. By the way, this gives me the opportunity to send a call for photometric survey of Beta Pictoris, which can be done by (expert) amateurs. Indeed, in 1994 we discovered that a planet likely transited in front of Beta Pictoris in 1981. In 1994, the claim for the observation of a transiting exoplanet was regarded as very suspicious. But the things have changed, and since 2008 we know that a planet orbits around Beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al. 2008), moreover the imaged planet is very consistent with a transit in 1981 (Lecavelier \u0026 Vidal-Madjar 2009). To predict when the next transit will happen a survey of Beta Pictoris photometry is needed. In that regard, the help from amateur can be useful. \n\u003Cbr\u003EA comment: in contrary to the title of the photo, the Beta Pictoris disk is not \u0022protoplanetary\u0022, this is a \u0022debris disk\u0022. The dust seen in the image is not massive enough for a new planet to form. This dust is produced by collision between asteroids and\/or evaporation of comets: the dusty grains captured in your photo are the debris of minor bodies orbiting in a young and active planetary system, similar to our own solar system when it was a few million years old. \n\u003Cbr\u003ECongratulation again ! \n\u003Cbr\u003EAlain Lecavelier des Etangs\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003EGuest j.berg100@chello.nl\t29-Nov-2011 13:05\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Econgratulations, Spectacular!\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003EGuest\t29-Nov-2011 10:11\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI take my hat off to you sir!

This is a very young system thought to be only around 12 million years old and is essentially similar to how our own Solar System must have formed some 4.5 billion years ago. The disc is seen edge-on from our perspective and appears in professional images as thin wedges or lines protruding radially from the central star in opposite directions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the last couple of years I have been wondering if it was possible for amateurs to capture this special target but have never come across any such images. The main difficulty is the overwhelming glare from Beta Pictoris itself which completely drowns out the dust disc that is circling very close to the star. Images of the disc taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and from big observatories, are usually made by physically blocking out the glare of Beta Pictoris itself within the optical path.\nBut I then found this excellent 1993 paper \u0027Observation of the central part of the beta Pictoris disk with an anti-blooming CCD\u0027 (Lecavelier des Etangs, A., Perrin, G., Ferlet, R., Vidal-Madjar, A., Colas, F., et al., 1993, A\u0026amp;A, 274, 877)\nFull article available here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1993A%26A...274..877L\u0022\u003Ehttp:\/\/adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1993A%26A...274..877L\u003C\/a\u003E\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realised that with this technique it might not be entirely impossible to also record the debris disc with relatively modest equipment. I followed the technique described in the paper above, which basically consists of imaging Beta and then taking another image of a similar reference star under the same conditions. The two images are subtracted from each other to eliminate the stellar glare, and the dust disc should then hopefully reveal itself. However, since the two stars have different magnitudes I needed to calculate how long to expose Alpha for in order to get a similar image which I could subtract from the Beta image:\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe magnitude difference between the stars is 3.86\u003Csub\u003E(Beta)\u003C\/sub\u003E - 3.30\u003Csub\u003E(Alpha)\u003C\/sub\u003E = 0.56\u003Cbr\u003E\nDue to the logarithmic nature of the magnitude scale we know that a difference of 1 magnitude equals a brightness ratio of 2.512. Therefore 2.512 to the power of the numerical magnitude difference then equals the variation in brightness.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.512\u003Csup\u003E0.56\u003C\/sup\u003E = 1.67, so it appears Alpha is 1.67 times brighter than Beta. This means that exposure for Alpha should be 1\/1.67 = 0.597 times that of Beta. \n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this approach I managed to capture the first amateur image of the debris disc on 16th November 2011. This image generated a lot of attention from both professional and amateur astronomers and was \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Publications\/25568386_qzQ6bq\u0022\u003Ereported in the media all over the world\u003C\/a\u003E.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the initial success of capturing the disc I was contacted by several people in the astronomy community, among which were Dr Grant Christie of Auckland\u0027s Stardome Observatory. Following his suggestions I had a go at imaging it again using shorter exposures. This was to minimise the area saturated by Beta Pictoris itself and potentially reveal more of the debris disc closer to the star. The ICX098BQ chip in the ToUCam saturates fairly quickly for bright stars, even at very short exposures. Since long exposures with my ToUCam can only be controlled in 0.5s increments I decided to use 7.0s and 4.0s for Beta and Alpha respectively, which translates to a factor of 0.571. This was very close to the calculated brightness factor of 0.597 and still significantly shorter than the 30.0s I used for the first image on 16\/11\/2011.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for this second image I collected 344 images of Beta Pictoris at 7.0 seconds each and 299 images of Alpha Pictoris at 4.0s each. Both sets of images were dark subtracted and stacked separately in Registax. I then subtracted the Alpha image from the Beta image in PixInsight LE, and also created the absolute difference between the two.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe absolute difference image is simply easier to work with, but the subtraction image was important as a reference to examine which of the stars had contributed the various parts of the difference. Below are both the subtraction result (left) and the absolute difference (right):\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E\n\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-vsnZ8D5\/2\/X3\/Abs-difference-X3.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-Gbpr8KR\/2\/X3\/Beta-minus-Alpha-X3.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\n\u003C\/center\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the subtraction image on the left contributions from Alpha Pictoris are dark, while contributions from Beta Pictoris are light. It is clear that there is a fairly strong signal corresponding to the exact location of the debris disc and that it is coming from the Beta image.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI created a more natural looking final image by taking the original stacked Beta image and then blending in the central parts from a stretched version of the absolute difference image that showed the dust disc. I decided to also keep the black spot of the central glare from the difference image since the contrast with the protruding disc just seems better this way. So there is no occulting disc involved, it is simply for the sake of presentation. I created a couple of versions which can be seen in the gallery below. This is a vastly better image than the first one taken on 16\/11\/2011. I believe the higher number of subframes (344 versus 55) coupled with the shorter exposure times are responsible for the improvement.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used MaximDL to produce some more in-depth illustrations of what is going on in the difference image. First a area plot of the intensity immediately around Beta Pictoris. The circular plateau in the centre corresponds to the saturated area caused by Beta Pictoris itself (The narrow trough immediately surrounding it is an artifact of the image processing). The debris disc is visible as the elevated red areas on each side of the star:\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-5fsxjwF\/2\/X3\/MaximDL-area-plot-X3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C\/center\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd profile plots taken both through the debris disc plane and perpendicular to it. The horizontal scale is Astronomical Units and the area saturated by Beta itself is highlighted on the plots:\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-f8Rgkwc\/2\/X3\/Profile-presentation-noframes-X3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C\/center\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe visible part of the debris disc seems to extend to roughly 250-300AU before it falls below the background noise levels. \nI have found that the limiting magnitude with the ToUCam from my location is around 20.0. So how far out should the debris disc theoretically be visible in my image?

This is because each pixel either receives only red, green or blue light due to the overlaid Bayer matrix. But since the matrix dyes are practically transparent to IR light, every pixel therefore receives signal from the IR band. So the IR S\/N ratio in the final image can be assumed to be correspondingly higher than the RGB S\/N. This could easily explain why the ToUCam seems to pick up IR light so well; the Bayer matrix effectively acts like a IR pass filter and allows a proportionally higher number of pixels to be IR illuminated than RGB illuminated.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile I have not tested this in practice it could mean that the limiting magnitude of the ToUCam is higher in IR than in RGB.\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003ERolf Wahl Olsen, 04\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C\/sup\u003E December 2011\u003C\/i\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EComments:\u003C\/h2\u003E\nI received a lot of kind and encouraging comments on my old site (\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.pbase.com\/rolfolsen\u0022\u003Ehttp:\/\/www.pbase.com\/rolfolsen\u003C\/a\u003E) about this image, so I have copied these comments below:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E(If you would like to leave a new comment please feel free to do so via the button at the very bottom of this page)\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003Eikkaisei\t09-Aug-2012 21:15\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EThis is encouraging work - what an effort.\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERob Craftsman\t01-Aug-2012 21:39\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFor a self-proclaimed first amateur (are you sure?? this is really good) pic of another solar system, this is really stunning.

It was a great time. I have no doubt that this is really the disk of Beta Pic that you have in your image: its looks so similar to what we obtained. Captured with a 10\u0022 telescope, your image represents a very nice achievement and a technical exploit. CONGRATULATION!! \n\u003Cbr\u003EAs I wrote to a journalist asking me, I feel that it is unlikely that your image can be used to learn something new about this Beta Pictoris system. But this is not the most important: the most important is that your image is impressive and beautiful. A beautiful image of a young planetary system 62 light-years away, a beautiful image among other beautiful images in your pbase galleries. \n\u003Cbr\u003ENonetheless, your work shows that amateur can obtain results which are potentially useful for scientists. In particular, I think about transit of exoplanets some of which can be surveyed by amateur astronomers. By the way, this gives me the opportunity to send a call for photometric survey of Beta Pictoris, which can be done by (expert) amateurs. Indeed, in 1994 we discovered that a planet likely transited in front of Beta Pictoris in 1981. In 1994, the claim for the observation of a transiting exoplanet was regarded as very suspicious. But the things have changed, and since 2008 we know that a planet orbits around Beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al. 2008), moreover the imaged planet is very consistent with a transit in 1981 (Lecavelier \u0026amp; Vidal-Madjar 2009). To predict when the next transit will happen a survey of Beta Pictoris photometry is needed. In that regard, the help from amateur can be useful. \n\u003Cbr\u003EA comment: in contrary to the title of the photo, the Beta Pictoris disk is not \u0022protoplanetary\u0022, this is a \u0022debris disk\u0022. The dust seen in the image is not massive enough for a new planet to form. This dust is produced by collision between asteroids and\/or evaporation of comets: the dusty grains captured in your photo are the debris of minor bodies orbiting in a young and active planetary system, similar to our own solar system when it was a few million years old. \n\u003Cbr\u003ECongratulation again ! \n\u003Cbr\u003EAlain Lecavelier des Etangs\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003EGuest j.berg100@chello.nl\t29-Nov-2011 13:05\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Econgratulations, Spectacular!\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003EGuest\t29-Nov-2011 10:11\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI take my hat off to you sir!

This is a very young system thought to be only around 12 million years old and is essentially similar to how our own Solar System must have formed some 4.5 billion years ago. The disc is seen edge-on from our perspective and appears in professional images as thin wedges or lines protruding radially from the central star in opposite directions.\nFor the last couple of years I have been wondering if it was possible for amateurs to capture this special target but have never come across any such images. The main difficulty is the overwhelming glare from Beta Pictoris itself which completely drowns out the dust disc that is circling very close to the star. Images of the disc taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and from big observatories, are usually made by physically blocking out the glare of Beta Pictoris itself within the optical path.\nBut I then found this excellent 1993 paper \u0027Observation of the central part of the beta Pictoris disk with an anti-blooming CCD\u0027 (Lecavelier des Etangs, A., Perrin, G., Ferlet, R., Vidal-Madjar, A., Colas, F., et al., 1993, A\u0026amp;A, 274, 877)\nFull article available here: http:\/\/adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1993A%26A...274..877L\n\n\nI realised that with this technique it might not be entirely impossible to also record the debris disc with relatively modest equipment. I followed the technique described in the paper above, which basically consists of imaging Beta and then taking another image of a similar reference star under the same conditions. The two images are subtracted from each other to eliminate the stellar glare, and the dust disc should then hopefully reveal itself. However, since the two stars have different magnitudes I needed to calculate how long to expose Alpha for in order to get a similar image which I could subtract from the Beta image:\n\n\nThe magnitude difference between the stars is 3.86(Beta) - 3.30(Alpha) = 0.56\nDue to the logarithmic nature of the magnitude scale we know that a difference of 1 magnitude equals a brightness ratio of 2.512. Therefore 2.512 to the power of the numerical magnitude difference then equals the variation in brightness.\n2.5120.56 = 1.67, so it appears Alpha is 1.67 times brighter than Beta. This means that exposure for Alpha should be 1\/1.67 = 0.597 times that of Beta. \n\n\nWith this approach I managed to capture the first amateur image of the debris disc on 16th November 2011. This image generated a lot of attention from both professional and amateur astronomers and was reported in the media all over the world.\n\n\nAfter the initial success of capturing the disc I was contacted by several people in the astronomy community, among which were Dr Grant Christie of Auckland\u0027s Stardome Observatory. Following his suggestions I had a go at imaging it again using shorter exposures. This was to minimise the area saturated by Beta Pictoris itself and potentially reveal more of the debris disc closer to the star. The ICX098BQ chip in the ToUCam saturates fairly quickly for bright stars, even at very short exposures. Since long exposures with my ToUCam can only be controlled in 0.5s increments I decided to use 7.0s and 4.0s for Beta and Alpha respectively, which translates to a factor of 0.571. This was very close to the calculated brightness factor of 0.597 and still significantly shorter than the 30.0s I used for the first image on 16\/11\/2011.\n\n\nSo for this second image I collected 344 images of Beta Pictoris at 7.0 seconds each and 299 images of Alpha Pictoris at 4.0s each. Both sets of images were dark subtracted and stacked separately in Registax. I then subtracted the Alpha image from the Beta image in PixInsight LE, and also created the absolute difference between the two.\nThe absolute difference image is simply easier to work with, but the subtraction image was important as a reference to examine which of the stars had contributed the various parts of the difference. Below are both the subtraction result (left) and the absolute difference (right):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the subtraction image on the left contributions from Alpha Pictoris are dark, while contributions from Beta Pictoris are light. It is clear that there is a fairly strong signal corresponding to the exact location of the debris disc and that it is coming from the Beta image.\n\n\nI created a more natural looking final image by taking the original stacked Beta image and then blending in the central parts from a stretched version of the absolute difference image that showed the dust disc. I decided to also keep the black spot of the central glare from the difference image since the contrast with the protruding disc just seems better this way. So there is no occulting disc involved, it is simply for the sake of presentation. I created a couple of versions which can be seen in the gallery below. This is a vastly better image than the first one taken on 16\/11\/2011. I believe the higher number of subframes (344 versus 55) coupled with the shorter exposure times are responsible for the improvement.\n\n\nI used MaximDL to produce some more in-depth illustrations of what is going on in the difference image. First a area plot of the intensity immediately around Beta Pictoris. The circular plateau in the centre corresponds to the saturated area caused by Beta Pictoris itself (The narrow trough immediately surrounding it is an artifact of the image processing). The debris disc is visible as the elevated red areas on each side of the star:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd profile plots taken both through the debris disc plane and perpendicular to it. The horizontal scale is Astronomical Units and the area saturated by Beta itself is highlighted on the plots:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visible part of the debris disc seems to extend to roughly 250-300AU before it falls below the background noise levels. \nI have found that the limiting magnitude with the ToUCam from my location is around 20.0. So how far out should the debris disc theoretically be visible in my image? This is a plot of the magnitude pr. square arcsecond for the debris disc (Smith, B. A. \u0026amp; Terrile, R. J. 1984, Science, 226, 1421 A Circumstellar Disk around Beta Pictoris): \n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems from the figure above that if a limiting magnitude of approximately 20.0 is assumed, then the debris disc should be visible out to somewhere around 250-300AU. This corresponds with what is seen in the profile plots above. \n\n\nThis annotated crop of the final image shows the extent of the debris disc on both sides of Beta itself:\n\n\n\n\n\nSome notes on ToUCam and IR sensitivity\nThe disc is most prominent in IR and fortunately the ICX098BQ CCD chip is very good at picking up signals in IR, probably on par with or even better than some modern CCD\u0027s in this aspect.\nAnother property of the ICX098BQ that helps here is actually the Bayer colour matrix. This is because each pixel either receives only red, green or blue light due to the overlaid Bayer matrix. But since the matrix dyes are practically transparent to IR light, every pixel therefore receives signal from the IR band. So the IR S\/N ratio in the final image can be assumed to be correspondingly higher than the RGB S\/N. This could easily explain why the ToUCam seems to pick up IR light so well; the Bayer matrix effectively acts like a IR pass filter and allows a proportionally higher number of pixels to be IR illuminated than RGB illuminated.\nWhile I have not tested this in practice it could mean that the limiting magnitude of the ToUCam is higher in IR than in RGB.\n\n\nRolf Wahl Olsen, 04th December 2011\n\n\n\nComments:\nI received a lot of kind and encouraging comments on my old site (http:\/\/www.pbase.com\/rolfolsen) about this image, so I have copied these comments below:\n(If you would like to leave a new comment please feel free to do so via the button at the very bottom of this page)\n\n\nikkaisei\t09-Aug-2012 21:15\nThis is encouraging work - what an effort.\n\nRob Craftsman\t01-Aug-2012 21:39\nFor a self-proclaimed first amateur (are you sure?? this is really good) pic of another solar system, this is really stunning.

The subtraction technique is a great idea. I wonder if you could get even better results with an ICX618 chip, which has greater sensitivity as well as being harder to saturate ! It may reveal even more of the disk... \nI love your presentation, too.

Peige Wise\n\nGuest agpvanlieshout@home.nl\t29-Nov-2011 15:47\nYeahhhhhhh great, feeling must be amazing\n\nGuest\t29-Nov-2011 13:51\nDear Mr Olsen, \nFirst: CONGRATULATION for this great image of the Beta Pictoris dust disk !! \nThis image remembers me when (with Guy Perrin, Alfred Vidal-Madjar, Fran\u00e7ois Colas and others) we obtained very similar images in 1992. It was a great time. I have no doubt that this is really the disk of Beta Pic that you have in your image: its looks so similar to what we obtained. Captured with a 10\u0022 telescope, your image represents a very nice achievement and a technical exploit. CONGRATULATION!! \nAs I wrote to a journalist asking me, I feel that it is unlikely that your image can be used to learn something new about this Beta Pictoris system. But this is not the most important: the most important is that your image is impressive and beautiful. A beautiful image of a young planetary system 62 light-years away, a beautiful image among other beautiful images in your pbase galleries. \nNonetheless, your work shows that amateur can obtain results which are potentially useful for scientists. In particular, I think about transit of exoplanets some of which can be surveyed by amateur astronomers. By the way, this gives me the opportunity to send a call for photometric survey of Beta Pictoris, which can be done by (expert) amateurs. Indeed, in 1994 we discovered that a planet likely transited in front of Beta Pictoris in 1981. In 1994, the claim for the observation of a transiting exoplanet was regarded as very suspicious. But the things have changed, and since 2008 we know that a planet orbits around Beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al. 2008), moreover the imaged planet is very consistent with a transit in 1981 (Lecavelier \u0026amp; Vidal-Madjar 2009). To predict when the next transit will happen a survey of Beta Pictoris photometry is needed. In that regard, the help from amateur can be useful. \nA comment: in contrary to the title of the photo, the Beta Pictoris disk is not \u0022protoplanetary\u0022, this is a \u0022debris disk\u0022. The dust seen in the image is not massive enough for a new planet to form. This dust is produced by collision between asteroids and\/or evaporation of comets: the dusty grains captured in your photo are the debris of minor bodies orbiting in a young and active planetary system, similar to our own solar system when it was a few million years old. \nCongratulation again ! \nAlain Lecavelier des Etangs\n\nGuest j.berg100@chello.nl\t29-Nov-2011 13:05\ncongratulations, Spectacular!\n\nGuest\t29-Nov-2011 10:11\nI take my hat off to you sir!

This is a very young system thought to be only around 12 million years old and is essentially similar to how our own Solar System must have formed some 4.5 billion years ago. The disc is seen edge-on from our perspective and appears in professional images as thin wedges or lines protruding radially from the central star in opposite directions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the last couple of years I have been wondering if it was possible for amateurs to capture this special target but have never come across any such images. The main difficulty is the overwhelming glare from Beta Pictoris itself which completely drowns out the dust disc that is circling very close to the star. Images of the disc taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and from big observatories, are usually made by physically blocking out the glare of Beta Pictoris itself within the optical path.\nBut I then found this excellent 1993 paper \u0027Observation of the central part of the beta Pictoris disk with an anti-blooming CCD\u0027 (Lecavelier des Etangs, A., Perrin, G., Ferlet, R., Vidal-Madjar, A., Colas, F., et al., 1993, A\u0026A, 274, 877)\nFull article available here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1993A%26A...274..877L\u0022\u003Ehttp:\/\/adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/1993A%26A...274..877L\u003C\/a\u003E\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realised that with this technique it might not be entirely impossible to also record the debris disc with relatively modest equipment. I followed the technique described in the paper above, which basically consists of imaging Beta and then taking another image of a similar reference star under the same conditions. The two images are subtracted from each other to eliminate the stellar glare, and the dust disc should then hopefully reveal itself. However, since the two stars have different magnitudes I needed to calculate how long to expose Alpha for in order to get a similar image which I could subtract from the Beta image:\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe magnitude difference between the stars is 3.86\u003Csub\u003E(Beta)\u003C\/sub\u003E - 3.30\u003Csub\u003E(Alpha)\u003C\/sub\u003E = 0.56\u003Cbr\u003E\nDue to the logarithmic nature of the magnitude scale we know that a difference of 1 magnitude equals a brightness ratio of 2.512. Therefore 2.512 to the power of the numerical magnitude difference then equals the variation in brightness.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.512\u003Csup\u003E0.56\u003C\/sup\u003E = 1.67, so it appears Alpha is 1.67 times brighter than Beta. This means that exposure for Alpha should be 1\/1.67 = 0.597 times that of Beta. \n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this approach I managed to capture the first amateur image of the debris disc on 16th November 2011. This image generated a lot of attention from both professional and amateur astronomers and was \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Publications\/25568386_qzQ6bq\u0022\u003Ereported in the media all over the world\u003C\/a\u003E.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the initial success of capturing the disc I was contacted by several people in the astronomy community, among which were Dr Grant Christie of Auckland\u0027s Stardome Observatory. Following his suggestions I had a go at imaging it again using shorter exposures. This was to minimise the area saturated by Beta Pictoris itself and potentially reveal more of the debris disc closer to the star. The ICX098BQ chip in the ToUCam saturates fairly quickly for bright stars, even at very short exposures. Since long exposures with my ToUCam can only be controlled in 0.5s increments I decided to use 7.0s and 4.0s for Beta and Alpha respectively, which translates to a factor of 0.571. This was very close to the calculated brightness factor of 0.597 and still significantly shorter than the 30.0s I used for the first image on 16\/11\/2011.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for this second image I collected 344 images of Beta Pictoris at 7.0 seconds each and 299 images of Alpha Pictoris at 4.0s each. Both sets of images were dark subtracted and stacked separately in Registax. I then subtracted the Alpha image from the Beta image in PixInsight LE, and also created the absolute difference between the two.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe absolute difference image is simply easier to work with, but the subtraction image was important as a reference to examine which of the stars had contributed the various parts of the difference. Below are both the subtraction result (left) and the absolute difference (right):\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E\n\u003Ctable\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-vsnZ8D5\/2\/X3\/Abs-difference-X3.jpg\u0022\/\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-Gbpr8KR\/2\/X3\/Beta-minus-Alpha-X3.jpg\u0022\/\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\n\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003C\/table\u003E\n\u003C\/center\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the subtraction image on the left contributions from Alpha Pictoris are dark, while contributions from Beta Pictoris are light. It is clear that there is a fairly strong signal corresponding to the exact location of the debris disc and that it is coming from the Beta image.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI created a more natural looking final image by taking the original stacked Beta image and then blending in the central parts from a stretched version of the absolute difference image that showed the dust disc. I decided to also keep the black spot of the central glare from the difference image since the contrast with the protruding disc just seems better this way. So there is no occulting disc involved, it is simply for the sake of presentation. I created a couple of versions which can be seen in the gallery below. This is a vastly better image than the first one taken on 16\/11\/2011. I believe the higher number of subframes (344 versus 55) coupled with the shorter exposure times are responsible for the improvement.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used MaximDL to produce some more in-depth illustrations of what is going on in the difference image. First a area plot of the intensity immediately around Beta Pictoris. The circular plateau in the centre corresponds to the saturated area caused by Beta Pictoris itself (The narrow trough immediately surrounding it is an artifact of the image processing). The debris disc is visible as the elevated red areas on each side of the star:\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ccenter\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http:\/\/www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com\/Astrophotography\/Beta-Pictoris\/i-5fsxjwF\/2\/X3\/MaximDL-area-plot-X3.jpg\u0022\/\u003E\u003C\/center\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd profile plots taken both through the debris disc plane and perpendicular to it.

So how far out should the debris disc theoretically be visible in my image?

This is because each pixel either receives only red, green or blue light due to the overlaid Bayer matrix. But since the matrix dyes are practically transparent to IR light, every pixel therefore receives signal from the IR band. So the IR S\/N ratio in the final image can be assumed to be correspondingly higher than the RGB S\/N. This could easily explain why the ToUCam seems to pick up IR light so well; the Bayer matrix effectively acts like a IR pass filter and allows a proportionally higher number of pixels to be IR illuminated than RGB illuminated.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile I have not tested this in practice it could mean that the limiting magnitude of the ToUCam is higher in IR than in RGB.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003ERolf Wahl Olsen, 04\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C\/sup\u003E December 2011\u003C\/i\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EComments:\u003C\/h2\u003E\nI received a lot of kind and encouraging comments on my old site (\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.pbase.com\/rolfolsen\u0022\u003Ehttp:\/\/www.pbase.com\/rolfolsen\u003C\/a\u003E) about this image, so I have copied these comments below:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E(If you would like to leave a new comment please feel free to do so via the button at the very bottom of this page)\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003Eikkaisei\t09-Aug-2012 21:15\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EThis is encouraging work - what an effort.\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERob Craftsman\t01-Aug-2012 21:39\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFor a self-proclaimed first amateur (are you sure?? this is really good) pic of another solar system, this is really stunning.

It was a great time. I have no doubt that this is really the disk of Beta Pic that you have in your image: its looks so similar to what we obtained. Captured with a 10\u0022 telescope, your image represents a very nice achievement and a technical exploit. CONGRATULATION!! \n\u003Cbr\u003EAs I wrote to a journalist asking me, I feel that it is unlikely that your image can be used to learn something new about this Beta Pictoris system. But this is not the most important: the most important is that your image is impressive and beautiful. A beautiful image of a young planetary system 62 light-years away, a beautiful image among other beautiful images in your pbase galleries. \n\u003Cbr\u003ENonetheless, your work shows that amateur can obtain results which are potentially useful for scientists. In particular, I think about transit of exoplanets some of which can be surveyed by amateur astronomers. By the way, this gives me the opportunity to send a call for photometric survey of Beta Pictoris, which can be done by (expert) amateurs. Indeed, in 1994 we discovered that a planet likely transited in front of Beta Pictoris in 1981. In 1994, the claim for the observation of a transiting exoplanet was regarded as very suspicious. But the things have changed, and since 2008 we know that a planet orbits around Beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al. 2008), moreover the imaged planet is very consistent with a transit in 1981 (Lecavelier \u0026 Vidal-Madjar 2009). To predict when the next transit will happen a survey of Beta Pictoris photometry is needed. In that regard, the help from amateur can be useful. \n\u003Cbr\u003EA comment: in contrary to the title of the photo, the Beta Pictoris disk is not \u0022protoplanetary\u0022, this is a \u0022debris disk\u0022. The dust seen in the image is not massive enough for a new planet to form. This dust is produced by collision between asteroids and\/or evaporation of comets: the dusty grains captured in your photo are the debris of minor bodies orbiting in a young and active planetary system, similar to our own solar system when it was a few million years old. \n\u003Cbr\u003ECongratulation again ! \n\u003Cbr\u003EAlain Lecavelier des Etangs\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003EGuest j.berg100@chello.nl\t29-Nov-2011 13:05\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Econgratulations, Spectacular!\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb\u003EGuest\t29-Nov-2011 10:11\u003C\/b\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI take my hat off to you sir!

This is a very young system thought to be only around 12 million years old and is essentially similar to how our own Solar System must have formed some 4.5 billion years ago. The disc is seen edge-on from our perspective and appears in professional images as thin wedges or lines protruding radially from the central star in opposite directions.<br>\nFor the last couple of years I have been wondering if it was possible for amateurs to capture this special target but have never come across any such images. The main difficulty is the overwhelming glare from Beta Pictoris itself which completely drowns out the dust disc that is circling very close to the star. Images of the disc taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and from big observatories, are usually made by physically blocking out the glare of Beta Pictoris itself within the optical path.\nBut I then found this excellent 1993 paper 'Observation of the central part of the beta Pictoris disk with an anti-blooming CCD' (Lecavelier des Etangs, A., Perrin, G., Ferlet, R., Vidal-Madjar, A., Colas, F., et al., 1993, A&amp;A, 274, 877)\nFull article available here: <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993A%26A...274..877L\">http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993A%26A...274..877L</a>\n</p>\n<p>\nI realised that with this technique it might not be entirely impossible to also record the debris disc with relatively modest equipment. I followed the technique described in the paper above, which basically consists of imaging Beta and then taking another image of a similar reference star under the same conditions. The two images are subtracted from each other to eliminate the stellar glare, and the dust disc should then hopefully reveal itself. However, since the two stars have different magnitudes I needed to calculate how long to expose Alpha for in order to get a similar image which I could subtract from the Beta image:\n</p>\n<p>\nThe magnitude difference between the stars is 3.86<sub>(Beta)</sub> - 3.30<sub>(Alpha)</sub> = 0.56<br>\nDue to the logarithmic nature of the magnitude scale we know that a difference of 1 magnitude equals a brightness ratio of 2.512. Therefore 2.512 to the power of the numerical magnitude difference then equals the variation in brightness.<br>\n2.512<sup>0.56</sup> = 1.67, so it appears Alpha is 1.67 times brighter than Beta. This means that exposure for Alpha should be 1/1.67 = 0.597 times that of Beta. \n</p>\n<p>\nWith this approach I managed to capture the first amateur image of the debris disc on 16th November 2011. This image generated a lot of attention from both professional and amateur astronomers and was <a href=\"http://www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com/Astrophotography/Publications/25568386_qzQ6bq\">reported in the media all over the world</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the initial success of capturing the disc I was contacted by several people in the astronomy community, among which were Dr Grant Christie of Auckland's Stardome Observatory. Following his suggestions I had a go at imaging it again using shorter exposures. This was to minimise the area saturated by Beta Pictoris itself and potentially reveal more of the debris disc closer to the star. The ICX098BQ chip in the ToUCam saturates fairly quickly for bright stars, even at very short exposures. Since long exposures with my ToUCam can only be controlled in 0.5s increments I decided to use 7.0s and 4.0s for Beta and Alpha respectively, which translates to a factor of 0.571. This was very close to the calculated brightness factor of 0.597 and still significantly shorter than the 30.0s I used for the first image on 16/11/2011.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo for this second image I collected 344 images of Beta Pictoris at 7.0 seconds each and 299 images of Alpha Pictoris at 4.0s each. Both sets of images were dark subtracted and stacked separately in Registax. I then subtracted the Alpha image from the Beta image in PixInsight LE, and also created the absolute difference between the two.<br>\nThe absolute difference image is simply easier to work with, but the subtraction image was important as a reference to examine which of the stars had contributed the various parts of the difference. Below are both the subtraction result (left) and the absolute difference (right):\n</p>\n<br>\n<center>\n\n<img src=\"http://www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com/Astrophotography/Beta-Pictoris/i-vsnZ8D5/2/X3/Abs-difference-X3.jpg\">\n<img src=\"http://www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com/Astrophotography/Beta-Pictoris/i-Gbpr8KR/2/X3/Beta-minus-Alpha-X3.jpg\">\n\n</center>\n<br>\n<p>\nIn the subtraction image on the left contributions from Alpha Pictoris are dark, while contributions from Beta Pictoris are light. It is clear that there is a fairly strong signal corresponding to the exact location of the debris disc and that it is coming from the Beta image.\n</p>\n<p>\nI created a more natural looking final image by taking the original stacked Beta image and then blending in the central parts from a stretched version of the absolute difference image that showed the dust disc. I decided to also keep the black spot of the central glare from the difference image since the contrast with the protruding disc just seems better this way. So there is no occulting disc involved, it is simply for the sake of presentation. I created a couple of versions which can be seen in the gallery below. This is a vastly better image than the first one taken on 16/11/2011. I believe the higher number of subframes (344 versus 55) coupled with the shorter exposure times are responsible for the improvement.\n</p>\n<p>\nI used MaximDL to produce some more in-depth illustrations of what is going on in the difference image. First a area plot of the intensity immediately around Beta Pictoris. The circular plateau in the centre corresponds to the saturated area caused by Beta Pictoris itself (The narrow trough immediately surrounding it is an artifact of the image processing). The debris disc is visible as the elevated red areas on each side of the star:\n</p>\n<br>\n<center><img src=\"http://www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com/Astrophotography/Beta-Pictoris/i-5fsxjwF/2/X3/MaximDL-area-plot-X3.jpg\"></center>\n<br>\n<p>\nAnd profile plots taken both through the debris disc plane and perpendicular to it. The horizontal scale is Astronomical Units and the area saturated by Beta itself is highlighted on the plots:\n</p>\n<br>\n<center><img src=\"http://www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com/Astrophotography/Beta-Pictoris/i-f8Rgkwc/2/X3/Profile-presentation-noframes-X3.jpg\"></center>\n<br>\n<p>\nThe visible part of the debris disc seems to extend to roughly 250-300AU before it falls below the background noise levels. \nI have found that the limiting magnitude with the ToUCam from my location is around 20.0. So how far out should the debris disc theoretically be visible in my image? This is a plot of the magnitude pr. square arcsecond for the debris disc (<a href=\"http://astro.berkeley.edu/~kalas/disksite/library/smith84a.pdf\">Smith, B. A. &amp; Terrile, R. J. 1984, Science, 226, 1421 A Circumstellar Disk around Beta Pictoris</a>): \n</p>\n<br>\n<center><img src=\"http://www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com/Astrophotography/Beta-Pictoris/i-Fhf3k92/2/X3/Disc-profile-1984-X3.jpg\"></center>\n<br>\n<p>\nIt seems from the figure above that if a limiting magnitude of approximately 20.0 is assumed, then the debris disc should be visible out to somewhere around 250-300AU. This corresponds with what is seen in the profile plots above. \n</p>\n<p>\nThis annotated crop of the final image shows the extent of the debris disc on both sides of Beta itself:\n</p>\n<br>\n<center><img src=\"http://www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com/Astrophotography/Beta-Pictoris/i-XfjpwMZ/3/X3/Annotated-zoom-X3.jpg\"></center>\n<br>\n<p>\n</p><h3>Some notes on ToUCam and IR sensitivity</h3><br>\nThe disc is most prominent in IR and fortunately the ICX098BQ CCD chip is very good at picking up signals in IR, probably on par with or even better than some modern CCD's in this aspect.<br>\nAnother property of the ICX098BQ that helps here is actually the Bayer colour matrix. This is because each pixel either receives only red, green or blue light due to the overlaid Bayer matrix. But since the matrix dyes are practically transparent to IR light, every pixel therefore receives signal from the IR band. So the IR S/N ratio in the final image can be assumed to be correspondingly higher than the RGB S/N. This could easily explain why the ToUCam seems to pick up IR light so well; the Bayer matrix effectively acts like a IR pass filter and allows a proportionally higher number of pixels to be IR illuminated than RGB illuminated.<br>\nWhile I have not tested this in practice it could mean that the limiting magnitude of the ToUCam is higher in IR than in RGB.\n<p></p>\n<br>\n<i>Rolf Wahl Olsen, 04<sup>th</sup> December 2011</i>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\nI received a lot of kind and encouraging comments on my old site (<a href=\"http://www.pbase.com/rolfolsen\">http://www.pbase.com/rolfolsen</a>) about this image, so I have copied these comments below:<br>\n<i>(If you would like to leave a new comment please feel free to do so via the button at the very bottom of this page)</i><br>\n<br>\n<p>\n<b>ikkaisei\t09-Aug-2012 21:15</b>\n<br>This is encouraging work - what an effort.\n<br>\n<br><b>Rob Craftsman\t01-Aug-2012 21:39</b>\n<br>For a self-proclaimed first amateur (are you sure?? this is really good) pic of another solar system, this is really stunning.

It was a great time. I have no doubt that this is really the disk of Beta Pic that you have in your image: its looks so similar to what we obtained. Captured with a 10\" telescope, your image represents a very nice achievement and a technical exploit. CONGRATULATION!! \n<br>As I wrote to a journalist asking me, I feel that it is unlikely that your image can be used to learn something new about this Beta Pictoris system. But this is not the most important: the most important is that your image is impressive and beautiful. A beautiful image of a young planetary system 62 light-years away, a beautiful image among other beautiful images in your pbase galleries. \n<br>Nonetheless, your work shows that amateur can obtain results which are potentially useful for scientists. In particular, I think about transit of exoplanets some of which can be surveyed by amateur astronomers. By the way, this gives me the opportunity to send a call for photometric survey of Beta Pictoris, which can be done by (expert) amateurs. Indeed, in 1994 we discovered that a planet likely transited in front of Beta Pictoris in 1981. In 1994, the claim for the observation of a transiting exoplanet was regarded as very suspicious. But the things have changed, and since 2008 we know that a planet orbits around Beta Pictoris (Lagrange et al. 2008), moreover the imaged planet is very consistent with a transit in 1981 (Lecavelier &amp; Vidal-Madjar 2009). To predict when the next transit will happen a survey of Beta Pictoris photometry is needed. In that regard, the help from amateur can be useful. \n<br>A comment: in contrary to the title of the photo, the Beta Pictoris disk is not \"protoplanetary\", this is a \"debris disk\". The dust seen in the image is not massive enough for a new planet to form. This dust is produced by collision between asteroids and/or evaporation of comets: the dusty grains captured in your photo are the debris of minor bodies orbiting in a young and active planetary system, similar to our own solar system when it was a few million years old. \n<br>Congratulation again ! \n<br>Alain Lecavelier des Etangs\n<br>\n<br><b>Guest j.berg100@chello.nl\t29-Nov-2011 13:05</b>\n<br>congratulations, Spectacular!\n<br>\n<br><b>Guest\t29-Nov-2011 10:11</b>\n<br>I take my hat off to you sir!

Diagrams from Your Own Images</h1>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com/Astrophotography/Star-Clusters/i-D4q2HTJ/2/M/M4-LRGB-1548x1200-M.jpg\"></center>\n<br>\n<p>\nI have created a couple of colour-magnitude diagrams for some of the globular clusters I have imaged. I was surprised with how successful it turned out and how simple the process was, so I'll briefly describe what I did here:\n</p><p>\nTo create these diagrams I downloaded the demo version of <a href=\"http://www.msb-astroart.com/\">AstroArt</a>. The demo lets you export a list of stars from an image, so that is perfect for this purpose.\nI used the stacked B and L raw FITS images to generate the data. First I loaded the B image into Astro Art. Then from the Tools menu I selected 'Find Stars' and entered desired number of stars and FWHM criteria. For Omega Centauri I chose for example 30,000 stars. For the other clusters I chose a smaller number since they are more compact and crowded and there aren't as many stars available for selection.\nThen I went to View -&gt; Stars and a table with all the selected stars is displayed. I sorted the rows according to X coordinate and saved the star data as a .sta file via right-click menu. \nI then repeated the proces for the L file, using the same star selection criteria.<br>\n(The .sta format is simply tab/space separated values and can be opened in any text editor)\n</p><p>\nThe main challenge was to somehow match each star in the two B/L .sta files and create one new file with correct magnitudes for the matched stars. Not all stars will be matched since AstroArt will not necessarily select the same stars in each image. So for this purpose I wrote a small <a href=\"http://gosu-lang.org/\">Gosu</a> program that scans the two files and matches the entries by their coordinates. The program also calculates the magnitudes based on the ADU count. The result is a third file with the magnitudes for each star that was matched in the B and L file. This way I ended up with around 10,000 matched stars with magnitudes out of the 30,000 stars I selected for Omega Centauri.\n</p><p>\nNow I could open this new file in Excel and create a scatter plot for the data, and voila a textbook perfect colour-magnitude diagram emerged, complete with red giant branch and horizontal branch. Encouraged by this I repeated the process for some other globular clusters with equally effective results, allthough with fewer stars.\n</p><p>\nTo ensure reasonably accurate B-V values for the globulars it is necessary to take the extinction, or interstellar reddening, into account. This is the difference between an objects observed color and the theoretical color which it would have if unaffected by extinction. The color excess E(B-V) is related to the B-V colour by:\n</p><p>\n    E(B-V) = (B-V)<sub><i>observed</i></sub> - (B-V)<sub><i>intrinsic</i></sub>\n</p><p>\nThe program allows for the extinction to be entered by the user and the intrinsic B-V values are then written in the output file. I used 'Catalog of Parameters for Milky Way Clobular Clusters' (W.E.Harris 2012) to look up the extinction E(B-V) for the globulars.\n</p><p>\nBelow are the resulting colour-magnitude diagrams for the globulars NGC 6752, Messier 4, Omega Centauri, Messier 80 and NGC5286.\n</p>","Keywords":"","SmugSearchable":1,"WorldSearchable":1,"SortIndex":"14","SecurityType":1,"EffectiveSecurityType":1,"ParentEffectiveSecurityType":1,"ShowCoverImage":false,"ParentPrivacyLevel":1,"HLImageKey":"6jS76nP","HasImages":true,"RemoteKey":"QWFVGg","SortDirection":"Ascending","SortMethod":"Position"}},"label":"Colour-Magnitude

Thanks to all for your inputs in this matter. My obvious major inspiration came from this beautifully constructed Newtonian: <a href=\"http://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/sl/sl-tels.html#ni-tel\">http://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/sl/sl-tels.html#ni-tel</a>\n<br>\n<br>\nI decided to build a 10\" to keep costs down, since my previous telescope was of this size and so I could simply reuse the optics for the time being. Also, I was not sure how much load I could safely put on the G-11 mount in practice while still maintaining smooth tracking for photography purposes. While a 12\" would be great I felt I'd rather have a stable tracking 10\" scope than a 12\", or larger, which might cause problems for the mount. Furthermore, the 10\" is just about the right size for my observatory, any larger and I think it might start to become too bulky to maneuver around in the dark - otherwise I would have to build a larger observatory.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe design consists of three parts: The mirror cell, the central box/brace and the secondary cage. The central brace was the first part I built, since this was the most critical component as it must be very strong and rigid in order to carry the telescope and eliminate flexure. I made this out of aluminium square tubing and some pieces of 40x40x3mm aluminium angle extrusions. I cut 12 pieces of square tubing at 45 degree anges and riveted them to the angles. The protruding angles would then later function as truss connectors. I opted for 3 square tubes per side instead of 2 because I wanted to make sure I had a good support for mounting the telescope onto the dovetail plate later. This structure alone was surprisingly rigid and ensured that everything stayed in place, but as this component would hold the entire weight of the OTA I asked a local metal smith to weld all the joints on it. The final resulting central brace was very light, beautifully simple, and yet extremely sturdy.\n<br>\n<br>\nNext thing to make was the mirror cell and secondary cage. I decided to make these from plywood as it would be much easier for me than using aluminium, and it seemed to be the long accepted tried and tested solution of ATM's. For the secondary cage I cut two identical rings with an inner diameter of 30cm from the plywood. For the mirror cell I realised the ring could be smaller (saving a bit of weight), since being close to the mirror it would not interfere with the optical path, so I cut this ring with an inner diameter of 27cm to acommodate the 25cm mirror (10 inches) plus a bit of wriggle room for adjustments. The adjustable mirror cell was then made by cutting a trifoil shape of the plywood and mounting this on the ring with three spring loaded bolts.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe two rings for the secondary cage were connected with 4 round 1\" alu tube pieces. I thought about how to connect the hollow tubes for a while before deciding to simply slip them over a wooden round and mounting them with a large screw at each end (see photos for details). The cage turned out to be very rigid, better than I expected.\n<br>\n<br>\nTo attach the focuser I turned to some 3mm aluminium plate I had lying around. I bent this to follow the inner OTA radius and made holes for attaching the focuser. I then chiseled out groowes on each cage ring and screwed the plate onto these, then mounted the focuser onto the plate.\n<br>\n<br>\nNow I had to weigh the components and make sure the central brace would be placed at the balance point which is the purpose of the Serrurier truss design.\nI hanged a board, of the same length as the OTA would be, from the ceiling and then hanged the mirror cell, with mirror attached, to one end. Then I hanged the secondary cage and the secondary holder + mirror to the other end. To make up for the weight of the CCD camera I plan to purchase I added a bag with a book of similar weight to the secondary end. I then shifted the attachement of the board around until the two ends were in perfect balance, and I could then simply measure the distances on the board to know how to place the components when assembling the trusses.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn order to assemble the trusses I laid out the components in the correct positions and measured the required length of the first truss tube for the upper half. I then cut that tube plus the other 7 tubes to the same length. Then I put the first tube in place and drilled a hole all the way through both the tube and the alu angle extrusion on the central brace which would be its attachment point. The tube was then fastened with a bolt with washers and lock nut. I repeated this for each tube, carefully measuring that the central brace and the secondary cage were aligned at all times. This whole process was then repeated when attaching the mirror cell.\n<br>\n<br>\nFor the spider I considered a number of different options. My old spider is a traditional 4 vane contraption, with the vanes made of thin metal bands. Even though the vanes are very thin the reality is that they are more often than not slightly twisted and so produce rather large 'fat' diffraction spikes. Also, no matter how thin this kind of spider vane is, it will only look thin to a light ray that enters exactly along the optical axis of the telescope. From any other angle it will inevitably look much fatter than a thin steel wire and thus produce much more prominent diffraction spikes. So I decided to instead make a offset wire spider. I got some great inspiration from Mark Cowan's minimalist wire spider design, <a href=\"http://www.raddobs.com/atm/wire%20spider/wirespider.htm\">http://www.raddobs.com/atm/wire spider/wirespider.htm</a>, but I decided to try for an absolute minimalist design where the entire positioning and collimation of the secondary is controlled only by the wires.\n<br>\n<br>\nFor the wire itself I used 9 gauge (0.23 mm) guitar steel strings. After toying with various ideas for fastening the strings to the secondary cage I simply went for guitar machine heads. I did this to ensure I would obtain smooth and exact control of the spider tensioning and positioning, and because it was just easier and more elegant than any home made solution I could think of. I went for 4 wire vanes rather than 3 simply because I like the cross-shaped diffraction pattern with 4 spikes better than the 6 I would get from having 3 vanes. Another reason was that there for a cross is more space between each of the 4 spikes which could be handy in case I will be imaging something that lies very close to a bright star. \n<br>\n<br>\nI attached the machine heads to small wooden blocks that can pivot around a screw. This way I got full control of the angle of each individual string, which is important in order to line up the strings completely and minimize the diffraction. \n<br>\n<br>\nThe mirror cell was completed by re-using part of the cell from my old telescope. The reason for this was that it was straight forward and would provide a stable and secure platform for the mirror without me having to make any additional parts. The old cell consisted of an aluminium plate with a 1cm high edge around the mirror. At the bottom of the plate were three cork pads to support the mirror, and on the sides were attached three clips to hold the mirror in place. These clips extended over the front of the mirror so to minimise diffraction effects I decided to get rid of them and instead simply mount the mirror on the plate with silicone. I removed the cork pads and put three blobs of silicone on the plate plus some spacers and then I lowered the mirror onto the blobs and let it rest on the spacers. Once the silicone had cured I then removed the spacers so the mirror was entirely held in place by only the silicone. I also added three blobs through the existing screw holes on the edge which were left from the clips. This fixated the mirror horizontally. Finally I wrapped black electrical tape around the outside of the plate right up to the edge of the mirror. I did this to further fix the mirror in place but also to enable my mirror dust cover to easily slip onto the aluminium plate, which has a slightly larger diameter than the mirror.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe dust cover was made from a black styrene sheet. I cut out a circle to fit the mirror holder and a long strip to wrap around in order to make a cap for the mirror. I welded the two parts together using some liquid plastic glue I had left from my model building days. This glue was some 20 years old, but still worked perfectly, leaving the resulting dust cap very strong and durable.","Keywords":"","SmugSearchable":1,"WorldSearchable":1,"SortIndex":"8","SecurityType":1,"EffectiveSecurityType":1,"ParentEffectiveSecurityType":1,"ShowCoverImage":false,"ParentPrivacyLevel":1,"HLImageKey":"jjSGnfG","HasImages":true,"RemoteKey":"CHP5wT","SortDirection":"Ascending","SortMethod":"Position"}},"label":"10 inch Serrurier Truss Newtonian","url":"https://www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com/Equipment/Serrurier-truss-newtonian"},{"children":[],"data":{"type":"node","typeInfo":{"NodeID":"xkGj5","ParentID":"Pbnrx","RemoteID":"26311067","Type":4,"Name":"12.5 inch Serrurier Truss Newtonian","UrlName":"125-inch-Serrurier-Truss","UrlPath":"/Equipment/125-inch-Serrurier-Truss","Url":"https://www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com/Equipment/125-inch-Serrurier-Truss","IDPath":"tsmGt,Pbnrx","HLSetting":2,"HLImageID":2192050462,"DateAdded":"1351934711","DateAddedDisplay":"November 03, 2012","DateModified":"1392114209","DateModifiedDisplay":"February 11, 2014","PasswordProtected":false,"IsPasswordUnlocked":true,"PrivacyLevel":1,"NodePrivacyLevel":1,"IsOwner":false,"HasChildren":false,"Depth":2,"Description":"<h2>12.5 inch Serrurier Truss Newtonian</h2>\n<br>\nAs a result of my primary mirror now being 17 years old, and never having been re-coated, I decided to replace it. I could have it re-coated, but that would mean shipping it overseas plus paying for the coating and the return shipping. And then I would be without a mirror for quite a while. Instead, I applied for funding from the <a href=\"http://www.rasnz.org.nz/InfoForm/KTInfo.htm%22\">Kingdon-Tomlinson Fund</a> and the Auckland Astronomical Society. And together they have generously approved to fund my purchase of a <a href=\"http://www.rfroyce.com/conical/\">R.F.Royce 12.5\" f/4 conical mirror</a>.\n<br>\n<br>\nThis is really all thanks to my <a href=\"http://www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com/Astrophotography/Beta-Pictoris\">Beta Pictoris image from 2011</a>. I have been very fortunate to get to know the good people of the Auckland Astronomical Society and in particular Dr. Grant Christie. This has been very rewarding and since December 2011 I have been invited to give various talks on Beta Pictoris and image processing to both the Auckland Astronomical Society, Tauranga Astronomical Society and latest at Auckland University of Technology. I also picked up my first astrophotography awards by winning the Scientific and Deep Sky sections of the <a href=\"http://astronomy.org.nz/pages/Documents/2012%20Winners%20Harry%20William%20Comp.pdf\">2012 Harry Williams Astrophotography Competition</a>. In addition I also won the Beaumont Prize that year for writing in the society journal, for an article about Beta Pictoris.\n<br>\n<br>\nSo now I'm building a larger scale version of my Serrurier truss Newtonian to house the new mirror. This is the same design as my <a href=\"http://www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com/Category/Serrurier-truss-newtonian\">10\" Serrurier truss Newtonian</a> built in 2011.\n<br>\n<br>\n12.5\" was the largest Newtonian I could fit in the observatory since I didn't want to go too low on focal ratio. Also, I want to keep the weight at a minimum because my current setup is tracking beautifully. For this build I'm applying some weight savings here and there and I hope the 12.5\" OTA with a conical mirror will weigh more or less the same as the old 10\" did with a standard mirror. So far I have completed the main structural elements: Upper cage, central brace and mirror cell. I'm now working on the details around the secondary holder and wire spider. The mirror is expected to be ready in January. In the meantime I aim to finish everything else and just leave the trusses to be cut to the correct length once I have the mirror and can balance the OTA properly.\n<br>\n<br>\nClick the pages back and forward to see all the images. I will add images here as the build progresses.\n<br>","Keywords":"","SmugSearchable":1,"WorldSearchable":1,"SortIndex":"21","SecurityType":1,"EffectiveSecurityType":1,"ParentEffectiveSecurityType":1,"ShowCoverImage":false,"ParentPrivacyLevel":1,"HLImageKey":"xS3sDf5","HasImages":true,"RemoteKey":"Qv7Pcw","SortDirection":"Ascending","SortMethod":"Position"}},"label":"12.5 inch Serrurier Truss Newtonian","url":"https://www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com/Equipment/125-inch-Serrurier-Truss"}],"data":{"type":"node","typeInfo":{"NodeID":"Pbnrx","ParentID":"tsmGt","RemoteID":"","Type":2,"Name":"Equipment","UrlName":"Equipment","UrlPath":"/Equipment","Url":"https://www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com/Equipment","IDPath":"tsmGt","HLSetting":0,"HLImageID":0,"DateAdded":"1375252308","DateAddedDisplay":"July 30, 2013","DateModified":"1392114209","DateModifiedDisplay":"February 11, 2014","PasswordProtected":false,"IsPasswordUnlocked":true,"PrivacyLevel":1,"NodePrivacyLevel":1,"IsOwner":false,"HasChildren":true,"Depth":1,"Description":"","Keywords":"","SmugSearchable":1,"WorldSearchable":1,"SortIndex":"8","SecurityType":1,"EffectiveSecurityType":1,"ParentEffectiveSecurityType":1,"ShowCoverImage":false,"ParentPrivacyLevel":1,"SortDirection":"Ascending","SortMethod":"SortIndex"}},"label":"Equipment","url":"https://www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com/Equipment"},{"children":[],"data":{"type":"node","typeInfo":{"NodeID":"HT8Dg","ParentID":"jH9Gz","RemoteID":"25330000","Type":4,"Name":"Space Art","UrlName":"Space-Art","UrlPath":"/SpaceArt/Space-Art","Url":"https://www.rolfolsenastrophotography.com/SpaceArt/Space-Art","IDPath":"tsmGt,jH9Gz","HLSetting":2,"HLImageID":2082605365,"DateAdded":"1347442525","DateAddedDisplay":"September 12, 2012","DateModified":"1347442813","DateModifiedDisplay":"September 12, 2012","PasswordProtected":false,"IsPasswordUnlocked":true,"PrivacyLevel":1,"NodePrivacyLevel":1,"IsOwner":false,"HasChildren":false,"Depth":2,"Description":"<h2>Space Art</h2>\n<br>\nI enjoy creating images of imaginary Space scenes, using 3D Studio Max.
